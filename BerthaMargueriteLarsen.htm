		<strong>My Magnificent Mother</strong><br />
		Bertha Augusta Margarita Larsen Weeks<br />
		<br />
		By Clyde E. Weeks, Jr.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Sixty-five years is a very long time for a person to be thinking about 
		his mother. But when a mother dies at a young age, those children she 
		leaves behind are faced with the reality of living the rest of their 
		lives without the benefit of their dear mother’s mortal presence and 
		companionship.<br />
		<br />
		Moreover, those spouses and children, who live out their own mortal 
		lives, over a good many years, are almost always prone to wonder how 
		their own lives might have taken different paths, had their mothers, 
		early in their young lives, not succumbed to the hazards and infirmities 
		to which flesh is subject on this planet Earth.<br />
		<br />
		History happens to everyone, but most people are so busy living their 
		lives of quiet desperation, that the significant, as well as 
		insignificant events of their lives, are never recorded, so that 
		generations who come after them may know the details of their lives.<br />
		<br />
		Fortunate, indeed, are the relatively few people, who leave behind them 
		some kind of record, so that their progeny can learn of the 
		circumstances, people and events, which have shaped their lives. Some of 
		the world’s most notable people have even inspired others to see the 
		need to record elements of their lives, which those who follow, may 
		later read and become either illuminated or incredulous.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>SHE KEPT A PERSONAL DIARY<br />
		</strong>Such a one was Bertha Augusta Margarita Larsen, who, in her 
		relatively young life, kept a personal diary over a two-year period, in 
		which she recorded her thoughts, her aspirations and activities, during 
		the time she was training to become a registered nurse at Dr. W.H. 
		Groves Latter-Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City.<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" src="img1D.gif" /><br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" src="img1F.gif" /><br />
		<br />
		But, whence came this enterprising young woman, determined to follow in 
		the footsteps of one of her heroines in history: Florence Nightingale, 
		storied advocate of enlightened nursing, during her valiant nursing 
		service in the Crimean War, as well as during her many years of service 
		as Superintendent of Nursing in England?<br />
		<br />
		Bertha Augusta Margarita Larsen was the daughter of immigrants from 
		Scandinavia, following the lure of a new religion and a new life in the 
		United States of America.<br />
		<br />
		Bertha’s mother, Inga Augusta Himmerman, was born August 27, 1869, in 
		Asa, Torp, Vesternorrland, Sweden. She was born just about 21 years 
		after Mormon pioneers, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints, entered Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847.<br />
		<br />
		While Inga Himmerman was a young adult in Sweden, she met two 
		proselytizing missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
		Saints, who had traveled all the way from the American West to 
		Scandinavia to seek converts to their church. Fascinated by their story 
		of an American youth, Joseph Smith Jr., she learned that he had seen 
		God, and was told by him, that he should be God’s instrument in 
		restoring Christ’s original church. Inga Himmerman embraced the new 
		church, headquartered in Salt Lake City, and resolved to find a way to 
		join the main body of the Church in America.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>MEMBERS OF LDS CHURCH<br />
		</strong>Meanwhile, young Inga met a young Swedish compatriot, named 
		Lars Ostlund. They married, became the parents of two sons: Dean and 
		Bert Ostlund. The couple immigrated to the United States to join the 
		main body of the church, and were, later, divorced.<br />
		<br />
		Some time after the divorce, Inga met an older man from Denmark in Utah, 
		fifteen years her senior, who also had become acquainted with the new 
		American church and had immigrated to Utah. Christian Larsen had been 
		born November 4, 1854, in Kamstrup, Vor Feve, Copenhagen, Denmark. After 
		a short courtship, Christian Larsen and Inga Himmerman were married and 
		lived for several years in northern Utah, near Bear Lake.<br />
		<br />
		In 1899 the Christian and Inga Larsen family joined a company of 32 
		other pioneer families, who were called by Brigham Young to leave Sevier 
		County and travel to settle some of the land around Cardston, Alberta, 
		Canada. Led by Bishop Theodore Brandley, the hardy company of LDS Saints 
		set out for that distant land, across the border and into the 
		newly-being-settled country of Canada.<br />
		<br />
		Waiting for them at the end of their long journey would be thousands of 
		acres of undeveloped land, from which they were expected to wrench a 
		living for their families and establish a thriving community of stalwart 
		believers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as promulgated by The Church of 
		Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br />
		<br />
		With faith in every footstep, Christian and Inga Larsen were assigned 
		their own homestead plot, as they set out to arrange some kind of 
		temporary shelter there, to serve until a proper home could be built to 
		house their family.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>HEROIC COOPERATIVE EFFORTS<br />
		</strong>Agriculture and its appurtenant occupations and labors were the 
		only options available to the new Canadians. Those people, who had 
		previously practiced farming skills in other settings around the world, 
		had a decided advantage over those whose talents lay in other 
		directions. However, the new settlers took an inventory of their 
		assorted skills and talents and through heroic cooperative efforts, 
		homes were built, farms were developed, schools were organized and towns 
		were established, around which their lives would revolve for generations 
		to come.<br />
		<br />
		Central to each of the small towns, established by these Mormon 
		pioneers, was a chapel of quite humble circumstances, where the 
		Latter-day Saints could hold their church meetings, and socialize.<br />
		<br />
		Sterling, Alberta, Canada, became the home of Christian and Inga Larsen. 
		The Larsens cleared the lands to which they were assigned, and taught 
		their five sons and one daughter the value of work.<br />
		<br />
		On December 8, 1900, Christian Wilford Larsen was born--the second boy 
		to be born in that area. <br />
		<br />
		Bertha Augusta Margarita Larsen, the Larsen’s only daughter, was born 
		April 11, 1903. A son, Seth, was born in 1907, and Grant was born in 
		1912.<br />
		<br />
		Life in Alberta, Canada, during the first half of the Twentieth Century 
		was challenging for most of its citizens. Cultivating the land in one 
		way or another occupied the time and efforts of its residents, and for 
		the Christian Larsen family, their agrarian society challenged every 
		member to participate in an environment, where the role of “good 
		neighbor” was well-understood.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>STRONG SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION<br />
		</strong>Although constantly challenged by the growing need for helping 
		hands to plant and harvest the fields, the Alberta schools received 
		strong support from the parents of the children, who attended school and 
		strove to succeed. Bertha Larsen was one of those, who took her 
		education very seriously, realizing how important it would surely become 
		later in her life.<br />
		<br />
		With the children of Sterling being educated and graded monthly in 12 
		different subjects, punctuality and regular attendance were given the 
		highest priority in every school. In the Galt School District public 
		schools, the Christian Larsen children were both encouraged and helped 
		by their parents to succeed in school.<br />
		<br />
		In each of their 12 school classes, students were graded thusly: A, 
		Excellent; B, Good; C, Fair; D, Poor; and E, Bad.<br />
		<br />
		The fact that young Bertha Larsen was an outstanding student in school, 
		is shown by this copy of her Monthly Report in Grade VII for 1916. 
		Although her “Deportment” was graded “B” for each of the four months, 
		her ranking in class fluctuated between first and second place.<br />
		<br />
		The Christian Larsen home was a typical Mormon home, with the close-knit 
		family kneeling for family prayers at the dining table at every meal. 
		Young Bertha had a special place in the hearts of her five brothers, in 
		spite of the occasional practical jokes she played on them.<br />
		<br />
		Even as a young child, Bertha was her mother’s willing ‘right hand,’ 
		said her brothers. She would help her mother prepare food and wash the 
		dishes, while making note of her mother’s recipes for favorite dishes, 
		which her family enjoyed. She also learned to sew clothing for herself, 
		as well as for her brothers.<br />
		An avid reader, Bertha was fond of perusing the works of Charles 
		Dickens, especially “A Christmas Carol” as well as historical accounts 
		of the development of western America. She was also captivated by the 
		exploits of Florence Nightingale, who had become a legend in her own 
		time through her exploits in the Crimean War.<br />
		<br />
		While visiting the gardens at Embley, England, Florence had received 
		what she described as her ‘calling’. Florence said she heard the voice 
		of God, calling her to do his work, but at that time, she had no idea 
		what that work would become.<br />
		From a well-to-do British family, Florence developed an interest in the 
		social questions of her day, made visits to the homes of the sick in 
		local villages, and began to investigate hospitals and the roles of 
		nurses in British society. She became a nurse, herself, and served as a 
		shining light for women, in her successful efforts to see the career of 
		nursing become a respected profession for women. <br />
		<br />
		By 1917 Bertha Larsen’s half-brothers, Gustav and Einer Ostlund had 
		gained their maturity, leaving their step-father’s and mother’s modest 
		home to go out on their own. Wilford Larsen was seventeen, and Bertha 
		was fourteen years old. Seth Larsen was ten years old, while Grant 
		Larsen was eight years old.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>THEIR WORLD CHANGED DRASTICALLY<br />
		</strong>Meanwhile, the Larsen’s world was about to change, more 
		drastically than they could have imagined.<br />
		<br />
		The Great Epidemic, also known as the ‘Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919,’ 
		caused the deaths of 675,000 Americans between September 1918 and June 
		1919. But it was also a plague that affected hundreds of thousands of 
		people all over the earth. It caused many more deaths than any of the 
		other epidemics which had preceded it.<br />
		<br />
		The epidemic was reported to have come in two waves. The first wave, in 
		the spring of 1918, took far less than the second. The United States and 
		the rest of the world had been exposed to such epidemics in the past, 
		but never at such a severe cost in human life.<br />
		<br />
		In Canada the worldwide influenza epidemic manifest itself, at least a 
		year earlier than in the United States. In the spring of 1917 the 
		specter of influenza visited the small town of Sterling, Alberta, 
		Canada, as well as a number of other Canadian communities. People were 
		getting sick. People were dying. But no one knew at that time how 
		immense the threat of that plague constituted to the rest of the world.<br />
		<br />
		Early in March, 1917, in Sterling, Alberta, Canada, 64-year-old 
		Christian Larsen was not feeling well. His body ached severely. His 
		fever was high and he suffered from chills. Nothing seemed to relieve 
		his illness.<br />
		<br />
		His wife, Inga, made him as comfortable as possible during his terminal 
		illness, and doctors were baffled as to what possible treatment might 
		thwart the disease. Christian Larsen, finally, died March 22, 1917. His 
		family was heartbroken.<br />
		<br />
		At that time, most doctors cited ‘pneumonia’ on the death certificates 
		of those who succumbed, since flu came first and weakened the resistance 
		of the sick; then pneumonia followed and was the eventual cause of death 
		for most people thus afflicted.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>DOUBLE TRAGEDY FOR FAMILY<br />
		</strong>And yet, the tragedy in the Larsen family was doubled seventeen 
		days later, when the virulent disease also took Inga Larsen, the mother 
		of the six children, on April 9, 1917.<br />
		<br />
		Of course, the Christian Larsen household was not the only family to be 
		devastated by the incipient onslaught of the influenza epidemic in their 
		rustic community, but the loss of both the parents in such a short time 
		frame presented a knotty problem of major proportions: where would the 
		under-age orphans live, and who would be responsible for their care and 
		rearing to adulthood?<br />
		<br />
		However, the Larsen family had lived in Canada for seventeen years. They 
		had made many friends and had been active in the Sterling Ward of The 
		Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The under-age orphaned 
		children--Wilford, Bertha, Seth and Grant-- were taken into the homes of 
		four separate Mormon foster families.<br />
		<br />
		Merlin and Alice Steed, who already had nine children of their own, 
		seven boys and two girls, invited seventeen-year-old Wilford to join 
		their family.<br />
		<br />
		He lived with them from the time he was seventeen, until he was called 
		on a proselytizing LDS mission to the Northern States in Chicago, when 
		he was nineteen.<br />
		<br />
		Fourteen-year-old Bertha Larsen took eight-year-old Grant to nearby 
		Tabor to live with the Peter Larsens (no relation), former residents of 
		Sterling. She returned and lived a short time with Lon and Hulda Nelson. 
		Then she went to live with her friend, Zula Kimball’s family and 
		attended the Knight Academy.<br />
		Ten-year-old Seth Larsen was welcomed into the family of Bishop Arthur 
		E. Fawns.<br />
		<br />
		Fortunately, the four children lived nearby each other in their new 
		family settings and were able to maintain their close family ties.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>BERTHA WANTED TO BE A NURSE<br />
		</strong>Meanwhile, Bertha’s admiration for Florence Nightingale 
		continued. Florence had died at home in England at the age of 90 on 
		August 13, 1910. In her old age she had received many honors, including 
		Great Britain’s Order of Merit and the Royal Red Cross.<br />
		<br />
		As she completed her studies at the Knight Academy, Bertha was strongly 
		impressed with the idea that she, too, might undertake a nursing career 
		and become a most productive and useful member of society.<br />
		<br />
		Florence Nightingale’s farsighted nursing reforms had widely influenced 
		the nature of modern health care, and her writings continued to be a 
		resource for nurses, health managers and planners. <br />
		<br />
		Encouraged in her aspirations by her friends and siblings, Bertha Larsen 
		prepared to leave Sterling, Alberta, Canada, and move to Salt Lake City, 
		Utah, planning to enroll for classes at the relatively new Dr. W.H. 
		Groves Latter-day Saints’ Hospital Training School.<br />
		<br />
		In 1921 Wilford Larsen returned to Sterling from his two-year mission in 
		Chicago. His fourteen-year-old brother, Seth, was still living with the 
		Arthur Fawns family, and twelve-year-old Grant, was then living with 
		Perry and May Burke in Sterling.<br />
		<br />
		Eighteen-year-old Bertha Larsen was ready to spread her wings and pursue 
		her dream of becoming a registered nurse. She kissed her brothers 
		‘good-by’ and set out for Salt Lake City, full of hope and faith that 
		life had many good things to offer her in the big city.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>DR. W.H. GROVES LATTER-DAY SAINTS HOSPITAL<br />
		</strong>Salt Lake City in 1921, the center of Mormonism, was a thriving 
		small metropolis in Utah—the Beehive State--which had developed in 
		three-quarters of a century from a sagebrush ridden valley on the shores 
		of the Great Salt Lake to the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy that the 
		desert shall “rejoice and blossom as the rose.”<br />
		<br />
		Upon her arrival in Salt Lake City, Bertha excitedly visited the center 
		of town, where Temple Square contained the LDS temple and tabernacle, 
		and the statue of Mormon Church President Brigham Young was seen, 
		welcoming new-comers to the city.<br />
		<br />
		Four blocks to the north of Brigham Young’s statue, and four blocks to 
		the east, Bertha discovered the Dr. W.H. Groves Latter-day Saints 
		Hospital and its School of Nursing. Bertha was overwhelmed to see the 
		magnificent towered brick structure, topped by the colorful stars and 
		stripes, which was the Flag of the United States of America.<br />
		<br />
		Rows of thriving trees surrounded the hospital and attractively set off 
		the magnificent hospital, located in the Avenues of Salt Lake City.<br />
		As she entered the large medical facility, there in the lobby, she saw 
		on a wall this large plaque, which reinforced, once again, her 
		determination to follow the bright path, inspired by her spiritual 
		mentor, Florence Nightingale:<br />
		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<img alt="Printable Quote FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE PLEDGE Nurse Gift | Etsy" src="il_570xN.1395665677_sgib.jpg" style="float: left"><div class="auto-style6">
		</div>
		<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
		The Dr. W.H. Groves LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, owned by the LDS 
		Church, was established in 1905. It was largely funded through a bequest 
		of W.H. Groves, an LDS dentist, who had come to Utah from Nottingham, 
		England. The hospital, a five-story complex with eighty beds, was 
		equipped with up-to-date medical equipment and innovations, including an 
		elevator and a nurse-calling system.<br />
		<br />
		Located nearby the hospital was the newly-constructed Nurses Home, which 
		would become the home to Bertha Larsen, as a student at the hospital’s 
		School of Nursing. The first class of graduating nurses from the School 
		of Nursing was in 1906.<br />
		<br />
		Bertha Larsen introduced herself to Lucy P. Pocock, R.N., Superintendent 
		of Nurses, and told her how excited she was to be accepted for admission 
		to the Hospital Training School.<br />
		<br />
		As Bertha reviewed the list of faculty members at the school, she was 
		mightily impressed with breadth of the curriculum and those, who would 
		be teaching her everything she needed to know about nursing.<br />
		<br />
		Beginning her nursing classes in July of 1921, Bertha eagerly undertook 
		a determined walk along the path, which she felt would lead to 
		fulfillment of her dreams of becoming a modern-day Florence Nightingale. 
		She embraced her fellow classmates as sisters, and had many friendly 
		interactions with members of the hospital staff, including 
		Superintendent Lucy Pocock.<br />
		<br />
		<img alt="" src="img22.jpg" /><br />
		<br />
		Early on, Bertha learned that her nursing education would involve not 
		only extensive reading and studying, but would also give her many 
		‘hands-on’ experiences in practical nursing with real doctors and very 
		authentic patients.<br />
		But, all was not nighttime assignments in operating rooms and emptying 
		bedpans. The LDS Hospital was also a Mecca for many young men, desiring 
		to date the attractive young student nurses residing there.<br />
		<br />
		Bertha soon found herself attending church services, dances and movies 
		with a succession of young men, who found her both attractive and 
		exciting to squire to various events happening in Salt Lake City.<br />
		<br />
		Moreover, there was a nearby United States Army post, located about 
		three miles east of Dr. Grove’s LDS Hospital, where several hundred 
		soldiers were stationed. Three years after the end of the great World 
		War, Fort Douglas was home to a rather large contingent of peace-time 
		soldiers, most of whom were single enlisted men.<br />
		<br />
		It was not surprising, that many of these young men were often found, 
		enjoying the activities and social life, which flourished in Salt Lake 
		City.<br />
		<br />
		Bertha was fond of dancing and going to the movies, and one evening, she 
		met one of those young soldiers at The Auditorium--one of Salt Lake’s 
		most popular dance halls. Staff Sergeant Clyde E. Weeks, recently having 
		returned from a two-year assignment in the Philippine Islands, was still 
		getting acquainted with the social life in Salt Lake City, when he spied 
		Bertha Larsen on the dance floor, dancing with another man.<br />
		<br />
		“What an attractive young lady,” he thought. “I would like to dance with 
		her!”<br />
		The dark-eyed Canadian beauty had no problem accepting Clyde’s 
		invitation to dance, and the merry-eyed soldier swept her into his arms 
		and danced her around the floor, like Rudolph Valentino.<br />
		The date was Saturday, October 6, 1923.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>AN AUSPICIOUS EVENING AT THE DANCE<br />
		</strong>Their meeting seemed to be rather unremarkable, for Bertha 
		wrote in her diary for that date: “I went up to Farmer’s office. Mr. 
		Scott was there, but I don’t think he likes me any more, but I still 
		like him. I went down to Lulu’s place and got ready and went to The 
		Auditorium at 9 o’clock. Met Clyde Weeks and he sure is cute. I came 
		home with him. We came home with Ben Stevens.”<br />
		<br />
		<strong>BERTHA’S DIARIES<br />
		</strong>For the first year and a half of Bertha’s sojourn at Dr. 
		Grove’s LDS Hospital, she led a fascinating life, learning all about the 
		mysteries about the human body and how caring and knowledgeable 
		professional caregivers can relieve the distress of ill and injured 
		bodies, as well as facilitating the healing of those on whom physicians 
		have plied their skills.<br />
		<br />
		And all the while, she remained a faithful member of The Church of Jesus 
		Christ of Latter-day Saints, regularly attending her meetings in the 
		local ward, as well as sessions of the General Conference of the Church, 
		held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.<br />
		<br />
		On New Years Day, 1923, Bertha Weeks was both surprised and pleased to 
		receive from the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
		Saints a small booklet, entitled “Up From The Hills--His Story” by N.C. 
		Hanks.<br />
		Inscribed inside the front cover was inscribed: 1923 Bertha Larsen: It 
		is with much pleasure that I present you with this copy of “Up from the 
		Hills.” It is the inspirational, personal story of a Utah boy, whose 
		faith and courage in overcoming extraordinary difficulties deeply 
		appealed to my sympathy and admiration. I think his story is the most 
		inspirational for young men and women I have ever read, with the 
		exception of that of Helen Keller, and puts to shame those of us who 
		have eyes and hands and become discouraged in the battle of life.<br />
		<br />
		Hoping that you and your loved ones had a very enjoyable Christmas, and 
		wishing you a bright and prosperous New Year.<br />
		<br />
		Very sincerely yours,<br />
		<br />
		HEBER J. GRANT <br />

		<br />
		For the remainder of her life, Bertha Larsen treasured this small 
		booklet. The personal story of N.C. Hanks had resonated, deeply with 
		this orphaned girl from Sterling, Alberta, Canada, who had lost both of 
		her parents in the great influenza epidemic that had plagued the world 
		in 1917-1919. Early on, she had determined that she would succeed, and 
		that she would make a difference in this world.<br />
		<br />
		While she was in nurse’s training at Dr. Groves LDS Hospital, Bertha 
		Larsen had many admirers. She was popular with the young men and enjoyed 
		their company, while all the while she was open to considering the 
		possibilities for a husband.<br />
		<br />
		The men who dated Bertha soon learned that she had high standards in her 
		associations with those of the opposite gender. Her two-year Diary, 
		begun January 1, 1923, well chronicles Bertha’s day-to-day interactions 
		with a number of men, whose associations she enjoyed.<br />
		<br />
		However, when the name of Clyde Weeks first appears in her diary, we see 
		a most remarkable change in her demeanor toward him, as well as to the 
		rest of the men she had been dating. On October 11, 1923, Bertha wrote: 
		“Haven’t eaten a thing all day and worried and worried myself to death. 
		I hope I can get over it soon. I really believe I like Clyde a little 
		bit or I would not feel so badly. Can’t wait till he calls tonight after 
		7 o’clock.”<br />
		<br />
		October 17, 1923: “Well, Clyde came up and we went down to the Paramount 
		to see ‘The Spanish Dancer’ and it sure was good. I was really glad to 
		see Clyde. Really, Dear Diary, I believe I like him a lot.”<br />
		<br />
		<strong>COURTING FOR OVER A YEAR<br />
		</strong>During the following year, there were many entries in Bertha’s 
		diary, detailing Bertha’s dates with several other men, as well as 
		frequent dates with Clyde Weeks. Complicating their relationship, 
		however, was the fact that Clyde was not a member of the LDS Church. 
		Because of that fact, at one point, she tried to break off their 
		relationship.<br />
		<br />
		However, she recalled later, “I suddenly had a peaceful feeling that 
		things would work out well for us. And they did!”<br />
		<br />
		On the anniversary of their first meeting, Bertha wrote: “October 6, 
		1924. Just one year ago to-night! Oh, Dear Diary, that was a happy 
		night, cause I met Clyde. And I love him more than anything else in the 
		world. He is so darn good, and I miss him so much. Clyde came up at 7:30 
		and I am so happy. I can’t get along without him. I know I’m not going 
		to even try. He’s mine and no one can take him from me! I love Clyde!”<br />
		<br />
		Bertha and Clyde’s romance was almost culminated on November 7, 1924: 
		“Oh, it is just one year and 1 month since Clyde and I started to go 
		together. Bless his heart; I love him, so much more than the whole wide 
		world. I’m taking my afternoon off, today, so I better stop and get 
		ready to leave.<br />
		<br />
		Clyde came up at 7:30, and we got a ring and headed for Farmington. But 
		when we got there, the mayor was not home, and so we had to come back 
		without getting hitched. Oh dear! More Fun!”<br />
		<br />
		<strong>A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN<br />
		</strong>Bertha’s diary page for November 8, 1924 reads: “Oh dear, this 
		morning we are going to do the deed! I came down to the office at 8:50, 
		but Clyde didn’t call; till 9:30. I met him and we went up to the County 
		building, and were married at about 10:05. Oh Boy! All my life is 
		changed. I’m a new girl! I’m so happy…cause Clyde is all my own now. We 
		are not going to tell anyone, since nursing students are not supposed to 
		get married!”<br />
		<br />
		However, Salt Lake County’s report of current marriages came out in the 
		newspaper on November 12, and it did not take long, before nearly 
		everyone who knew Bertha, had heard about her marriage to Clyde Weeks.
		<br />
		<br />
		Two days later, Clyde and Bertha moved into the small apartment they had 
		discovered near the hospital. Bertha’s diary recalled: “Went out on my 
		noon hour today and got towels and sheets, etc. etc. and I am just 
		thrilled to death. It’s going to be so much fun getting started and 
		everything. I couldn’t wait till 5:30 arrived, hardly. I left at 5:00 
		and headed home to my hubby. Bless his heart. I love him so much, and we 
		are going to be just awfully happy. We had the best little dinner! Oh! 
		It seems so good to have Clyde home in the evening. I love him so much!”<br />
		<br />
		Needless to say, spring rolled around. Bertha passed her Board 
		Examinations, and on May 27, 1924, Graduation Exercises of the Dr. W.H. 
		Groves Latter-day Saints Hospital School of Nursing were held in the 
		Assembly Hall on Temple Square.<br />
		<br />
		The twenty-five nursing graduates of the School of Nursing, including 
		Bertha Larsen Weeks and her good friend, Dorothy Tuttle of Manti, Utah, 
		received their white nursing uniform caps, denoting their new status as 
		graduates and registered nurses.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>HONEYMOON IN THE ORIENT<br />
		</strong>Meanwhile, a honeymoon in the Orient became a possibility for 
		Clyde and Bertha Weeks. Clyde had described to Bertha his recent Army 
		assignment in the Philippine Islands, from where he had departed with 
		glowing recommendations from his superiors. He asked Bertha if she would 
		be interested in going back with him to The Philippines on another duty 
		assignment. Bertha was excited at the possibility of foreign travel and 
		quickly agreed to his proposal.<br />
		<br />
		A quick exchange of cablegrams between Fort Douglas and Manila resulted 
		in the approval of Sergeant Weeks’ transfer back to Manila. Clyde and 
		Bertha packed their bags and on September 25, 1925, they boarded the 
		train for San Francisco, where they found the U.S. Thomas anchored in 
		the bay, waiting to be their home for the long voyage across the 
		Pacific.<br />
		<br />
		Their journey together across the Pacific Ocean proved to be a relaxing 
		and enjoyable honeymoon, as Clyde recounted to Bertha the details of his 
		first voyage across the Pacific in 1918, during the Great War, which saw 
		him serve his first Army years in Vladivostok, Russia.<br />
		<br />
		A happy circumstance on their voyage was that Bertha was pregnant. 
		Arriving in the Philippine Islands, Clyde and Bertha were assigned to 
		occupy very pleasant housing on the wall of the old walled city of 
		Cuartel-de-Espania in Manila.<br />
		On November 18, 1925, Clyde E. Weeks, Jr. was born in the Sternberg 
		General Hospital in Manila. As a registered nurse, herself, the birth of 
		her first child was not the first birth in which Bertha had 
		participated. And it would not be the last.<br />
		From this point on, the lives of Bertha Larsen and Clyde E. Weeks were 
		wedded eternally. <br />
