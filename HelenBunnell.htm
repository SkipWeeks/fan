		<p><span>My Mother My Mother’s maiden name is Helen Bunnell. She was 
		born August 17, 1926. Her Mother was Zelda Holdaway and her Father was 
		Joel Bunnell. My Mother is a physically beautiful and extremely creative 
		and talented woman. She is the Mother of nine children. She is very 
		musical and has performed in numerous musical productions and operas as 
		a leading lady singing soprano. I remember in my youth when she 
		performed the leading female role in productions of Madame Butterfly and 
		La Bohemme produced by the Utah Valley Opera Association. I fondly 
		remember the songs from these operas and others, still. There is 
		something really beautiful and unique about Puccini’s music. </span></p>

		<p><span>&#65279;I remember a lot of music that my parents enjoyed in our home 
		during my youth. When I was young, Rogers and Hammerstein and other 
		musicals were at the height of their popularity. The music from these 
		productions such as South Pacific, Oklahoma, Kismet, Music Man, West 
		Side Story, The King and I, The Sound of Music, and others were an 
		important part of my youth. My Mother and Father loved music, operas, 
		musicals, and everything associated with these experiences. Music 
		permeated our home. My Mother sang at hundreds, if not thousands of 
		events from weddings to funerals, to church meetings and private 
		parties, especially during my youth. It seemed to me that she was 
		continually singing or preparing to sing somewhere. I remember that 
		sometime in the late fifties or early sixties she was asked to join a 
		singing group called the Singing Mothers, to travel to England to 
		perform as representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day 
		Saints, at various locations there. I remember that she took a silent 
		movie camera with her and she still has these movies that we see on 
		occasion. Later she joined the Tabernacle Choir and sang with that 
		prestigious group for several years, during which time, she also 
		traveled to a number of places around the world to perform with the 
		Choir.</span></p>

		<img class="ng-star-inserted" height="1281" src="1949HelenSkip.jpg" width="850" /><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>I remember my Mother to be a very loving, nurturing and 
		committed Mother. I have always felt her love and her devotion. She is 
		an emotionally intense person with a very strong and dominant 
		personality. You would never accuse her of being timid. She loved to 
		perform and provided a very good example to her children to feel free to 
		get up in front of large or small groups to perform without any kind of 
		fear. We got lots of opportunities to do so in our family. I remember 
		one period of time during my teenage years when my Mother decided to put 
		together a small family production of The Sound of Music with my Mother 
		playing the role of the governess, as played by Julie Andrews in the 
		movie version. My Father played the role of the Father, Captain VonTrapp 
		and each of us children would play the roles of the VonTrapp children. 
		We took this little play around the community and performed it for 
		various private parties and community events. I remember that I sang “I 
		Am Sixteen Going On Seventeen” as a duet with my sister Melody in this 
		production. We also sang a song called “Doe a Dear, A Female Dear”, and 
		others.</span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>My Mother always did things in a big way. When she cooked, she 
		cooked in quantity. When she sewed, she sewed in quantity. When she 
		sang, she did it in a big way. Everything with her was always pretty 
		intense. No one that ever met her would ever forget her. She had a 
		unique personality that was strong, passionate, and unmistakable. She 
		was and is a committed Mother that is eternally and unconditionally 
		bound to her children. She is loving and spiritually sensitive. She is 
		drawn to the light, but has been frustrated in her search for it. She 
		will ultimately find it. I love her.</span></p>
