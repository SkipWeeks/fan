		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I 
		particularly remember the smells of this old house. While Grandma lived 
		there, she did so with her second husband Earl Wall. I remember that he 
		smoked cigarettes and by the time I met him, he was getting pretty old 
		and was pretty inactive. I remember that most of the time, he just sat 
		in his rocking chair in the south end of the kitchen, smoking or in the 
		dark, dingy living room watching the Friday night fights, smoking. I 
		also remember their space heater in the living room on the east wall. It 
		was a dark brown unit that heated the entire room. The stairs to the 
		upstairs bedrooms were wide and very steep. I wonder, now, how my 
		Grandparents were able to climb up these steep stairs at their age. I 
		guess that she wasn’t that old, when I knew her. I believe that she died 
		at about the age of 76 or 77. I was eighteen at that the time, and 
		remember going to her funeral. Before she died, Earl died and she and 
		her children decided to tear down the old house and replace it with a 
		new one. It was in this new home that she eventually died in her sleep, 
		lying on her bed. Somehow, I was fortunate enough to receive a nice 
		pioneer vintage desk from my Grandmother’s estate. The desk has a roll 
		top base with a slide-out work surface and a bookshelf top with two 
		doors that open. Several years ago, I had a friend refinish the desk and 
		add an oak crown molding around the top of the bookshelf. It is now in 
		our daughter Amie’s home.</span></p>

		stale gum. Grandma would always cook home-made bread and spread butter 
		and sprinkle sugar on it for us. Her kitchen smells made her home feel 
		good. It was very different from our home, but I liked it, except for 
		the cigarette smoke which hurt my eyes. </span></p>

		would then be cut into large blocks, which they would use for cleaning 
		their hands, showering, and their laundry. It always seemed weird that 
		she would do this, when my Mother just went to the store and bought soap 
		and the store soap smelled a lot better. </span></p>

		that this was where she had a buried cesspool. This meant that her home 
		was not connected to the public sewer system. I remember fantasizing 
		about what a scary, dark place this must be. It always made me 
		uncomfortable to walk over this unusual place. I was always just a 
		little worried, that it might cave in and cause me to fall in, never to 
		be heard from again. Luckily, I never did fall in.</span></p>

		raspberry plants out in the back of her yard. I think that Earl kept a 
		horse out in the back yard, also. It seems like I remember Earl and my 
		uncle Neal rode horses together. It seems like I remember hearing that 
		they both went on some kind of endurance ride together, somewhere around 
		Payson canyon. It was supposed to be some kind of grueling race. I don’t 
		suppose either of them won the race. I got the impression that the race 
		was some kind of annual affair. I don’t remember hearing of it since. I 
		must have been very young.</span></p>

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">My Grandma 
		seemed to be my connection with the older generation and everything old. 
		Her generation seemed to me to be almost contemporaries with the Mormon 
		pioneers. It seemed like Grandma’s family was pretty close and held 
		family reunions quite often each summer. I remember the endless 
		conversations about genealogy that went on and on at these events, as my 
		Mother would talk to other family members and want to identify where 
		they tied into the family tree. She would get into these discussions 
		with almost everyone she met, it seemed. I remember the feelings I felt 
		when I realized that one of these discussions was beginning. Terror. I 
		knew that it was going to be an eternity, before we could go on. It 
		seemed that the most preferred relationships would be from the 
		“Vineyard” area of Orem. The area along the Geneva road on the west side 
		of the valley, just east of Utah lake, between about Center street and 
		1600 south. This is where the Holdaways and Bunnells were from. In all 
		fairness, as I look back on these conversations, I understand now how 
		normal these were. But as a child, I felt like they were never ending. I 
		just didn’t have any interest at the time in these things. Now, as I 
		meet people from areas where I have lived, I do the same thing. It’s 
		interesting how we become our parents.</span></p>

		That group of men was asked by President Brigham Young to travel to 
		California to assist the federal government there and in exchange the 
		government would provide desperately needed income to contribute to the

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We all had to 
		work very hard on our thirty-acre farm. It was difficult to do 
		everything that had to be done. We had three or four cows most of the 
		time. I had to separate the milk every morning. We raised our own pigs 
		and chickens. On the east part of the farm, the ground was rocky. We 
		planted fruit trees and berries there. We had an orchard of Cherry trees 
		for fifteen years and it never did bear fruit. The old grove of trees 
		where Joel's father had his packing shed was dynamited out in about 
		1932. This gave us more land to plant berries on. There was a cold 
		spring of water in the grove of trees. I used to keep my butter wrapped 
		in a wet cloth near this cool water to keep it fresh. Our house was 
		always cool because of the high ceilings and 52 trees Joel's father had 
		planted around it. There were Ash, Maple, White Birch, and Tree of 
		Heaven. To keep the pork from spoiling, we would put the pork in a brine 
		made of salt and water strong enough to float an egg. West of the house 
		was rich, brown soil. Joel rotated crops to enrich the soil. We raised 
		Tomatoes, Cantaloupe, Watermelon, Carrots, Potatoes – all good things 
		for a garden; Corn, Cucumbers, Beets, Onions, String Beans, Peppers, 
		Lettuce, Turnips, and Peaches, Pears, Plums, Apples, and Grapes.</span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We worked so 
		hard. Our day would start very early. During the berry season, we'd get 
		up at 4:30 so as to get as much done as possible before the hot sun. It 
		was so cold that early, with the cold canyon breeze, your hands would be 
		too stiff to pick very quickly. But before long, the kids would be 
		praying for rain to cool them off. One morning, Neal curled up in the 
		middle of a wide row of Raspberries, pulled up his old brown coat over 
		his ears and went back to sleep. It wasn't long until he came screaming 
		to the house for someone had found his secret hiding place and doused

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the 
		fruit was all picked, Joel would begin loading the truck. He would take 
		a couple of the children and head up the canyon for Heber, Park City or 
		Kamas to peddle the fruit – house to house: “Would you like any nice 
		fresh fruit today?”, the children would ask. For lunch, we'd buy sweet 
		rolls, cheese, and milk. How delicious that would taste. We'd stay until 
		the load was all gone.</span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I cooked on a 
		coal range. It was big and black. We polished it with a stove 
		blackening. Every so often the soot that collected under the oven would 
		have to be burned out. We'd crumple a piece of newspaper up and push it 
		into the hole under the oven, then set it afire. The soot would catch 
		fire and go up the chimney in big chunks. The ashes would have to be 
		taken out almost every day. Kindling and coal would have to be brought 
		in and stacked by the stove each night. The fire died down at night and 
		the house was cold. Designs of ice would be all over the windows in the 
		morning. New fires would have to be made every morning.</span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We had an 
		unusual farm because of the different soil of various types. The upper 
		part, being rocky, was good to grow fruit and berries. Around the house, 
		the soil was rich for garden vegetables. Down below was a sand hill 
		where the hay completed with the sand burrs for survival. How the kids 
		hated to ride the wagon and tromp the hay with all those sand burrs. 
		Grandma Bunnell used to say this hill, where all the sand burrs grew, 
		was an old Indian Burial Ground. She used to watch the Indians in their 
		ceremonial dances. Below the sand burrs was pastureland. At one time, 
		Joel tried to drain it. He worked so hard putting in a drain down 
		through that clay soil. He dug it about six feet deep. It worked pretty 
		good. He was able to plant and raise some good celery there. He put a 
		cement ditch all the way down south of the pasture to carry water to the 
		young Peach trees he planted on the sand hill. They never seemed to get 
		enough water to survive. They never did produce. The children found many 
		arrowheads on the sand hill.</span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />

		It was the very first one in Vineyard. My, but Joel was proud. He was a 
		very handsome young man. Always neat and clean – a real dandy. We worked 
		very hard. We'd get up with the sun and go to bed early. We lived and 
		worked the same hours as the chickens as it was expensive to stay up and 
		use a lamp. We had to pay $300 to get electricity to the house from 
		Vicklunds. We had a radio when they first came out. Before that, we had 
		an old Victorola record player. During the First World War, prices went 
		up on sugar and flour very high. The depression years were hard. Even 
		though we all worked very hard, sometimes we'd get an early frost that 
		would take practically everything. We'd save our own cantaloupe seed and 
		mellow seed to plant the next year. Frequently we'd have to borrow to 
		buy seeds and plants for the coming year.</span><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />

		this most difficult to do. We helped make mattresses by going down to 
		the old Vineyard school and pounded the cotton into the ticking, then 
		sewed it up with heavy cord. To pay for the kid's lunches, we sent milk

		a little more and more, until the North property line was just twenty 
		feed from the house. Joel was in poor health at this time and was 
		getting sicker. We traded what was left of the farm and the house to 
		LaVon Vernon for the property where I live now. There was an old station 
		house they had hauled in from Soldiers Summit. It was a miserable old 
		house, cold, rickity and smelly. We moved in about 1938. It was still 
		cold weather. It was about in March. Helen got pleurisy from the cold 
		draught sleeping on the floor the first night. She sang the lead in the 
		Jr. High School Operetta: “Lady of the Terrace”, the day we moved in.</span></p>

		weaker. He died on 31st of October 1940. (In his 54th year.) I went down

		come back. When I got home Saturday night, Earl was waiting to see me 
		and Norma had asked him to stay Sunday, so he did. He said he was

		dressed Kay and Ronald. Your mother is going to marry the most honorable 
		man in the world. We would have been married today on Jess's and Grandma 
		Holdaway's wedding day, but we'll have to wait five months. Well, it's 
		Thanksgiving and my heart's so full of thankfulness it's about to burst. 
		There's one thing I'm thankful for, as bad as I want him that we 
		couldn't get married. We'll have another test to prove our strength and 
		when we do get married, we'll know we can trust each other to the end of 
		the earth if need be. Another thing I'm thankful for is that he came 
		while Grandma Bunnell was still here. I took him over last night and 
		told her the most wonderful love story she had ever heard and some day 
		maybe I'll tell it to the world. I told her Earl would love to call her 
		mother if she would let him and we were going to do all we could to make 
		her life the happiest she has every known. She said she was glad I had 
		come and talked to her and wants us to come a much as we can, which of 
		course we'll do.</span></p>

		<span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There's 
		another thing I'm thankful for, and I guess you'll laugh at it, and that 
		is that he came before my hair all turned gray. I guess you'll say to 
		yourself: “What made her think he'd come?” Well, it's this: I always 
		felt that if I lived a good, clean life and raised my family the same 
		way, this happiness would come to me. And when we shook hands, we both 
		knew it had, but he didn't even kiss me till the next day. He knew how I 
		felt towards him. Then, when I was in his arms, for which I had waited 
		so long, he kissed the tears away. When I danced with him the other 
		night, I felt like I could dance through life with him. He's only been 
		here a little over a week and we have been to two dances and to church. 
		They hold church conjointly at the Scera and there was a man there who 
		was the President of the European Mission at the outbreak of the war. He 
		gave one of the most wonderful talks I have ever heard. He visits the 
		camps where our boys are. One night, there was only one left in camp and 
		he asked where the others were? He said they had gone to the other end 
		of town for a night of revelry. “Why didn't you go?” the speaker asked. 
		He said: “I have just received a letter from my dad telling how he 
		believed in me and trusted me and do you think I could go after that?” 
		He said how important it is that we write letters to the boys whether 
		they belong to us or not. We are going to church every Sunday and I am 
		going to pay tithing. Then we are going to another honorable man, Bishop 
		Gappmeyer, and ask for a recommend. How I wish that all of you could go 
		through with us. There'll be five months to prepare and I don't see why 
		you can't. How thankful I am that I have been so my girls could come to 
		me with their problems. There's no one in the world that has more to be 
		thankful for that I have today. To think that I could go through life 
		with two handsome men loving me and another good thing about it is that 
		they resemble each other, having the same blue eyes. Grandma Bunnell 
		said so last night. Sunday, Helen was combing my hair by the window and 
		he had gone and gotten in the truck. As he drove by I said “Oh, Helen, 
		Look!” He looked so much like Pop I had to cry. I've made the footprints 
		for you children to step in and I don't think you have missed many. If 
		this letter will be the means of living so you can get a recommend, I 
		will be the happiest person in the world. How I wish I had been more 
		pleasant and given you the love you craved. I'm going to try to make up 
		to my grandchildren what I didn't give my children. And whatever time 
		and money I have, I'm going to use to try to make someone happy. I can't 
		help but feel there has been a higher power than ours that has had a 
		hand in shaping our lives.. . .</span></p>
