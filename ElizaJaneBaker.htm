		<span class="auto-style3"><strong>History of Eliza Jane Baker Peay <br />
		</strong>Born 1834 <br />
		Died 1915 <br />
		<br />
		Biography written by her daughter, Rosetta Pricilla Peay Wride <br />
		<br />
		My mother, Eliza Jane Baker Peay was born in Poole, Dorchester, England 
		May 18, 1834. Her mother died when she was eleven years old, so she went 
		out as a nurse- maid in families where a girl was needed to care for 
		children. She was kept busy so did not get to school any after that, but 
		she was very good at figures, spelling and reading. She loved to read 
		and took great pleasure in her books and magazines. After her father 
		joined the church, he was anxious to go to Utah; but as he was unable to 
		do so at the time, he decided to send mother who was then eighteen. She 
		was put in the charge of a man and wife who were sailing with a group of 
		saints. My father, Francis Peay was born in Sussex, England September 
		23, 1825. As a boy of seven, he was apprenticed out to a ship builder. 
		This became his trade and in young manhood he was married to Prudence 
		Collyer. They had two little sons. It was about this time that my mother 
		first became acquainted with my father and his wife. She said she used 
		to see this fine looking well-dressed man and his wife and sons go to 
		chapel and admired him thinking that she would be proud to have a 
		husband such as he. His happiness with his wife and sons were very 
		short, for the family took scarlet fever and his wife and both sons died 
		within a few days of each other, my father being ill at the time. In the 
		year 1852 father sent his mother, a sister and two brothers to America, 
		remaining behind to earn money for his journey over. The following year 
		when he arrived in America he was much disappointed and very sad to 
		learn his mother had died. It happened that the ship that Mother sailed 
		on was the same one on which Francis Peay, my Father, was sailing. Their 
		acquaintance was renewed and each being lonely there was a bond between 
		them, which soon ripened into love, and they were married on board ship 
		by Elder Jacob Gates. They were on board ship for eleven weeks. When 
		they landed they had to leave many of their possessions, as there was 
		not room in the wagons of the company they came to Utah with. They had 
		many hardships along with the rest of the company, among who were 
		Brother Charles Savage, Brother William Eddington and other prominent 
		Utah pioneers. I have heard mother say she walked most of the way across 
		the plains. They came to Provo and took up a homestead in the western 
		part of what is now known as Provo City, Utah. During the Indian 
		trouble, they had to move into the Fort, but as soon as the trouble was 
		settled, they went back to the farm; Father planted peach pits all 
		around the outside of the farm, and when they grew up, mother and we 
		girls gathered the delicious fruit and dried enough to buy our first 
		stove. The first home father built on the farm was built with adobe 
		walls, the adobe being made by mother, the children and himself; and the 
		roof was thatched with rushes and hauled from the shores of Utah Lake. 
		Mother made lye from wood ashes in a leach or large barrel with a tap at 
		the bottom to allow the lye to drain. From the lye she made soap, using 
		grease or fat for the base ingredient. She also made the candles. She 
		made dye from dogwood berries and made medicine from roots, herbs and 
		berries of different kinds. Onion oil she used as medicine, and to check 
		vomiting she used the dried and grated chicken gizzard skins. They had 
		their socials and good times in the form of corn husking bees, ground 
		cherry shelling, ect. Our farm was an ideal place for picnics. A large 
		creek with wild roses growing on its banks flowed through the farm and 
		the Sunday School used to go there for their outings. Father was 
		interested in promoting mining and did much prospecting and hauling 
		supplies to Tintic district for the miners. For years mother churned 
		butter and packed it in ten pound buckets and shipped it to Salt Lake 
		twice a week. She walked long distances to carry it to the depot. She 
		also delivered butter and eggs to regular customers in Provo, walking 
		several miles in the process. She was a great lover of flowers and 
		raised many kinds both in the garden and in her home. Mother and Father 
		had twelve children, six boys and six girls, ten living to maturity. We 
		children loved to sit on the porch, in the evenings and have mother and 
		father sing to us. They had good voices and were indeed lovers of music. 
		Father led the choir at Provo for several years. He died at the age of 
		79 and mother at 81 years. Additional information about Eliza Jane 
		Baker: Eliza Jane was baptized April 7, 1851. She was the oldest child 
		in her family. She had two brothers and three step- brothers and two 
		step- sisters. Lilly, the youngest daughter of Eliza spoke of a swing 
		they had, on their farm in Provo, that they could go back and forth 
		across the stream of water that flowed by their house. She said they had 
		a big cellar, big enough to drive a wagon into. They had many kinds of 
		fruit and vegetables to store in it. They also raised sheep as she told 
		of carding the wool to make quilts. He mother would read to the family 
		at mealtimes and this love of reading carried over to her children. 
		Whenever Lily spoke of her parents it was always with love and respect. 
		Eliza Jane Baker spent the last years of her life with her daughter, 
		Prudence, in Vineyard. She was completely helpless for many years and 
		bed-ridden. Her daughter lovingly cared for her to the end. She died 
		August 7, 1915 in Vineyard, Utah, at the home of her daughter. She was a 
		refined, cultured, intelligent, hardworking, and industrious. She left a 
		wonderful posterity and we owe her a great debt of gratitude. </span></td>
