		<p><span>My Father’s name is Clyde Everett Weeks, Jr. He was born in 
		Manila, The Philippines on November 18,1925. His Father’s name is Clyde 
		Everett Weeks and his Mother’s name is Bertha Margarita Larsen. The 
		reason that my Father was born in the Philippines is that his Father was 
		serving in the United States army at that time. Shortly after my 
		Father’s birth, his family moved to Utah where his Father was stationed 
		at Fort Douglas, near the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. So, I 
		guess that you could call my Dad an army brat. He tells us interesting 
		stories of his life at Fort Douglas where he learned to catch trout with 
		his bare hands and take hikes up on Red Butte, behind Fort Douglas.
		</span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>His Mother died when he was just 16 and is buried in the Fort 
		Douglas cemetery. Her grave is located in the north east corner of the 
		cemetery, should you want to go there some time to see it. It is a 
		small, peaceful place. You should go there sometime to see the place. My 
		Dad tells a story of when he was an infant and still living in the 
		Philippines. He was crawling around in the back yard when his nanny was 
		babysitting him one day. A large python snake came over the fence and 
		approached him. As he tells the story, the baby sitter saved him from 
		death just in the nick of time. I’m glad he lived through that one.
		</span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>My Father is a poet and a writer. He has written for newspapers 
		for my entire life. He has written poems, even longer. He loves to write 
		poems using iambic pentameter and you can always tell when he’s working 
		on a new one, because he will be carrying a yellow legal pad of paper 
		around with him and silently counting out the meter on the fingers of 
		his hand. He has written poems on every conceivable subject you can 
		imagine: from death, to marriage to Skippy Peanut Butter. That’s right, 
		Skippy Peanut Butter. A year or two ago, he noted how much he enjoyed 
		this brand of peanut butter and decided to write a poem about it. After 
		he finished the poem, he liked it so much that he decided to send it to 
		the company, so that they could enjoy it too. And you’ll never guess 
		what happened. They sent him a letter thanking him for his kindness and 
		included a lifetime supply of coupons for him to get free peanut butter. 
		Incidentally, I was called Skippy Peanut Butter during my youth. I hated 
		it when my friends did this but I guess that I would have done the same, 
		if they had been called “Skippy Weeks”. It would have been just too 
		tempting. </span></p>

		<img class="ng-star-inserted" height="1339" src="1949-08-08DAD&BabySkip.jpg" width="850" /><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>He has always been a wonderful example to his family to never 
		be afraid to promote yourself. He has used some pretty creative 
		approaches throughout his life to promote himself and his family. He 
		once ran for Mayor of Orem. He served on the Orem City Council, the 
		SCERA Board of Directors and as the Postmaster of Orem for 40 years. 
		While he was Postmaster, he ended up building two new Post Offices, as 
		the city continually grew to outstrip each previous building. He retired 
		a few years ago and has since then been free to spend more time with 
		each of his children. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>My Father served in the U.S. Marines in World War II. I don’t 
		know much about his experience in this terrible conflict, other than 
		that he was awarded the Purple Heart for acting with valor and being 
		seriously wounded. His leg was permanently damaged by an exploding hand 
		grenade. The wound almost blew off his foot and the lower part of his 
		leg. He never talks about it but bears it with courage. The wound 
		destroyed the tendons and ligaments in the front of his lower leg, 
		making it impossible for him to lift his foot up. For years he wore a 
		spring-loaded brace on this foot that would keep his foot in the raised 
		position so that he would not trip over it. Within the last few years he 
		has stopped wearing the brace and seems to be able to walk without any 
		noticeable difficulty. Perhaps the surrounding muscles have strengthened 
		to enable him to avoid the brace. I can’t imagine what a sacrifice this 
		must have caused him over the years. In spite of this serious handicap 
		he has always been active and helpful in lots of physical things that 
		needed to be done around the house. My hat’s off to you Dad for your 
		courage! </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>He has written a column called originally “This Weeks’ Wit” or 
		more recently “Under Timpanogos Green”. These articles chronicle his 
		perspectives about life and his community. This creative outlet has been 
		a gift of love from my Dad to his community. He has always loved Orem 
		and I’m sure he always will. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>Dad is a loving Father. He has always been loyally committed to 
		the health and well-being of his wife and each of his children. He has 
		always worked hard to provide financially for his family and been a 
		wonderful example of constancy, amid the uncertainty of the world around 
		us. I love him. </span></p>

		<h1><strong>This is a Brief Biography of Clyde E. Weeks, Jr.</strong></h1>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>On February 15, 1943, seventeen-year-old Clyde E. Weeks, Jr. 
		boarded the Orem electric train at the Curtis Station, then, located at 
		today's 1200 South Orem Boulevard, and traveled to Salt Lake City, where 
		he was sworn in as a United States Marine and sent off to join the South 
		Pacific battles of World War II. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>On September 8, 1945, Clyde Weeks, wounded in the United 
		States' invasion of Guam, returned home from that war on that very same 
		Orem electric train, and has lived here ever since. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>While attending BYU in 1946, and also writing a weekly 
		newspaper column about Orem in the Provo Daily Herald, Clyde deplored in 
		his column, the lack of a library in the City of Orem. A few days later, 
		Orem Mayor l.W. Gillman telephoned Clyde and explained to him that the 
		Orem Library had been closed during World War II and had not been 
		re-opened. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>&quot;Since you are so concerned about a library for Orem, I am 
		hereby commissioning you to get the old library open and running again,&quot; 
		said Mayor Gillman. &quot;You will have to solicit contributions from the 
		public to do it, until the City Council can levy a library tax to fund 
		it,&quot; he said. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>Clyde, with his wife, Helen, accepted the challenge. They got 
		the library key and opened the long-closed door of the library, located 
		in the basement of the old Orem City Hall. They found a dingy room, 
		littered with old war-time ration stamps, book shelves covered with 
		musty sheets of paper and spider webs hanging from the ceilings. </span>
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
		<img class="verticaltimeline-content ng-tns-c22-5 ng-star-inserted" height="605" src="2006-02-18_Clyde%20&%20Helen%20Weeks.jpg" width="850" /><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>Rounding up brooms, vacuums and other cleaning equipment, they 
		removed the grimy sheets of paper from the book shelves, cleaned out the 
		filthy room and polished the floor. Through his newspaper column, Clyde 
		solicited funds and contributions of books from the public, and obtained 
		enough money to hire a librarian for five hours a day. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>With the levying of the one-half mill library tax by the city 
		council, the Orem City Library was finally opened all day, and Clyde 
		Weeks was named chairman of the new Orem Library Board. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>Meanwhile, also in 1946, Clyde Weeks received a telephone call 
		from P.K. Nielson, manager of the Orem-Geneva Times. He said: &quot;Clyde, 
		our owner and publisher, Arthur V. Watkins, has been elected to the 
		United States Senate. He is leaving next week. I would like to invite 
		you to become the Managing Editor of the Orem-Geneva Times.&quot; Clyde 
		accepted the job. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>In 1947 Clyde was asked to become secretary of Orem's Utah 
		Centennial Committee, and he joined the Orem Lions Club. In 1951 Clyde 
		Weeks was appointed permanent Postmaster of the City of Orem, where he 
		served for forty years. During that time, he also continued writing his 
		weekly columns and reporting Orem City news in the Orem-Geneva Times.
		</span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>Over the years, Clyde Weeks has served as president of the Orem 
		Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the Orem Betterment Committee, 
		president of the Orem Kiwanis Club, president of the Orem Boosters, 
		Inc., president of the SCERA Board of Directors, member of the Orem 
		Bicentennial Committee, and author/publisher of the Orem Peace Officer 
		magazine for five years. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>One evening in 1960, during an Orem City Council meeting, Clyde 
		Weeks was commissioned to write and publish &quot;Sagebrush to Steel-An Orem 
		Centennial History,&quot; Orem's first history book, published in 1961.
		</span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>From 1974 to 1980 Clyde Weeks wrote and published the monthly 
		&quot;Orem City Happenings&quot; newsletter for Orem City, which was mailed for 63 
		months with Orem's monthly utility bills. </span></p>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p><span>On the occasion of the City of Or em's Ninetieth Birthday on 
		May 5, 2009 four copies of Clyde Weeks' latest book, &quot;City of Orem 
		Millennial History-1861-2009, &quot; have been given by Clyde Weeks to the 
		City of Orem Library for the use of its citizens. He hopes that future 
		generations of Orem history students may find them useful for years to 
		come. </span></p>
