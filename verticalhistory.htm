			<td class="auto-style97">
			<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">My paternal Grandfather is Clyde Everett Weeks. 
			He died of cancer in September 1979. We called him “Dad”, presumably 
			because my parents did when we were young. He was a handsome man 
			with pure white hair. He had an interesting life. I understand that 
			his father was not particularly ambitious or much of a leader in his 
			home and that my Grandfather left home in Lansing, Michigan when he 
			was relatively young as he lied about his age of 16 in order to join 
			the army. I believe that they let him in because he registered for 
			the draft when he was only 16. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">He soon found himself in Vladivostok, Siberia, 
			in Russia during World War I. His career in the army continued 
			through World War II. He was married in 1924 to Bertha Larsen. I 
			never met her, but understand that she was a nurse. My Father has 
			spoken fondly of her, but I really know little about her life, other 
			than the fact that she was my Father’s Mother and that she also had 
			two other children, Sharee and Michael. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">This began a second life for my Grandfather. He 
			became assistant manager of the Singer Sewing Machine center in 
			Provo on Center street, where he worked for several years. He soon 
			met Emily Gatiker at the Singer Sewing Center. He repaired her 
			sewing machine. Emily was a lovely woman, who had suffered through a 
			stressful divorce from her first husband, a Mr. Stoddard. Emily came 
			to be known at Aunt Emily. We would often go to visit “Dad &amp; Emily” 
			on Sunday afternoons, during my youth. Emily brought with her four 
			children from her previous marriage. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Their names are Myrna, Martin, Karen, and Glen. 
			They also had one daughter, whom they named Jerri Susan. She was a 
			year younger, than I. They lived on about 420 East 200 North in 
			Provo. Emily worked at BYU in the Alumni Department. One day, she 
			heard that there was an opening in the new BYU Development Fund 
			Department at BYU. My Grandfather applied for the job and got became 
			BYU’s Assistant Development Director. He ultimately ended up working 
			there until his retirement. His responsibilities included 
			negotiating with people and arranging for bequeathments and 
			donations to the university. I remember going to his office in the 
			administration building at the university, when I was a young man, 
			to visit him. It seemed like a very nice place to work. He seemed to 
			be very highly respected and enjoyed his work. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">He had beautiful handwriting. I remember, that 
			every birthday, I would receive a special birthday card from him 
			with a crisp $1 dollar bill. I always looked forward to this kind 
			thought. My Father’s Father grew up in Lansing, Michigan. The Weeks 
			family originated in England. Originally, I understand that the name 
			was Wicks. It is supposed to have changed after these people 
			migrated to America. Perhaps it changed even before this. I guess I 
			can check this out in my genealogy, which I will include at the end 
			of this history. My Father’s Mother, Bertha Larsen grew up in 
			Canada. Her family was from Denmark. She had two brothers named 
			Grant and Wilford. There may have been other brothers but I don’t 
			remember any sisters. I know little about her other than that she 
			was a nurse and that she died of cancer when my Father was 16 years 
			old.<o:p></o:p></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">I did know my maternal Grandmother though and I 
			love her. Her name is Zelda Holdaway Bunnell. She lived in Orem on 
			1600 South and about 200 or 300 East. I remember her original home 
			there. It was an old two story gray house. I particularly remember 
			the smells of this old house. While Grandma lived there, she did so 
			with her second husband Earl Wall. I remember that he smoked 
			cigarettes and by the time I met him, he was getting pretty old and 
			was pretty inactive. I remember that most of the time, he just sat 
			in his rocking chair in the south end of the kitchen, smoking or in 
			the dark, dingy living room watching the Friday night fights, 
			smoking. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I also remember their space heater in the 
			living room on the east wall. It was a dark brown unit that heated 
			the entire room. The stairs to the upstairs bedrooms were wide and 
			very steep. I wonder, now, how my Grandparents were able to climb up 
			these steep stairs at their age. I guess that she wasn’t that old, 
			when I knew her. I believe that she died at about the age of 76 or 
			77. I was eighteen at that the time, and remember going to her 
			funeral. Before she died, Earl died and she and her children decided 
			to tear down the old house and replace it with a new one. It was in 
			this new home that she eventually died in her sleep, lying on her 
			bed. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Somehow, I was fortunate enough to receive a 
			nice pioneer vintage desk from my Grandmother’s estate. The desk has 
			a roll top base with a slide-out work surface and a bookshelf top 
			with two doors that open. Several years ago, I had a friend refinish 
			the desk and add an oak crown molding around the top of the 
			bookshelf. It is now in our daughter Amie’s home. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I remember finding pieces of stale spearmint 
			doublemint gum in the west kitchen window sill. What a treat. 
			Perhaps this is where I got my appetite for stale gum. Grandma would 
			always cook home-made bread and spread butter and sprinkle sugar on 
			it for us. Her kitchen smells made her home feel good. It was very 
			different from our home, but I liked it, except for the cigarette 
			smoke which hurt my eyes. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Grandma would also make her own lye soap by 
			rendering tallow or fat from animal fat and adding lye and cooking 
			the solution and pouring it into bars that would then be cut into 
			large blocks, which they would use for cleaning their hands, 
			showering, and their laundry. It always seemed weird that she would 
			do this, when my Mother just went to the store and bought soap and 
			the store soap smelled a lot better. The lye soap really had an odd 
			smell to it. I guess that Grandma’s generation was probably the last 
			one in our country that made their own soap. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">While walking around her back yard, one day, I 
			heard a hollow sound. I later found that this was where she had a 
			buried cesspool. This meant that her home was not connected to the 
			public sewer system. I remember fantasizing about what a scary, dark 
			place this must be. It always made me uncomfortable to walk over 
			this unusual place. I was always just a little worried, that it 
			might cave in and cause me to fall in, never to be heard from again. 
			Luckily, I never did fall in. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Grandma had very long grey hair. She would 
			braid it and loop it around the top of her head, to keep it from 
			getting in her way. She had a bunch of raspberry plants out in the 
			back of her yard. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I think that Earl kept a horse out in the back 
			yard, also. It seems like I remember Earl and my uncle Neal rode 
			horses together. It seems like I remember hearing that they both 
			went on some kind of endurance ride together, somewhere around 
			Payson canyon. It was supposed to be some kind of grueling race. I 
			don’t suppose either of them won the race. I got the impression that 
			the race was some kind of annual affair. I don’t remember hearing of 
			it since. I must have been very young. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">My Grandma seemed to be my connection with the 
			older generation and everything old. Her generation seemed to me to 
			be almost contemporaries with the Mormon pioneers. It seemed like 
			Grandma’s family was pretty close and held family reunions quite 
			often each summer. I remember the endless conversations about 
			genealogy that went on and on at these events, as my Mother would 
			talk to other family members and want to identify where they tied 
			into the family tree. She would get into these discussions with 
			almost everyone she met, it seemed. I remember the feelings I felt 
			when I realized that one of these discussions was beginning. Terror. 
			I knew that it was going to be an eternity, before we could go on. 
			It seemed that the most preferred relationships would be from the 
			“Vineyard” area of Orem. The area along the Geneva road on the west 
			side of the valley, just east of Utah lake, between about Center 
			street and 1600 south. This is where the Holdaways and Bunnells were 
			from. In all fairness, as I look back on these conversations, I 
			understand now how normal these were. But as a child, I felt like 
			they were never ending. I just didn’t have any interest at the time 
			in these things. Now, as I meet people from areas where I have 
			lived, I do the same thing. It’s interesting how we become our 
			parents. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">My maternal ancestors were Mormon pioneers. 
			They were noble, honorable people that believed the story of Joseph 
			Smith the Mormon prophet and made their way to Utah to live their 
			religion. One of my ancestors on my Mother’s side was named Shadrack 
			Holdaway. He was a member of the Mormon Battalion. That group of men 
			was asked by President Brigham Young to travel to California to 
			assist the federal government there and in exchange the government 
			would provide desperately needed income to contribute to the 
			migration effort of the church to the Utah area. When we lived in 
			San Diego, I remember seeing his name at the Mormon Battalion 
			Memorial exhibit, which is maintained by the church in the Old Town 
			area of San Diego. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">My mother's mother is Zelda Maud Holdaway. She 
			was born on 17 January 1889 in Provo, Utah. She died on 2 August 
			1967. She is buried by her husband in the Provo Cemetary. Her father 
			is Marion Haws Holdaway, born in 1855 and her mother is Prudence 
			Eliza Peay, born in 1854. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">This is her life sketch, as dictated to my 
			mother, Helen Weeks: <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">“I was born in Provo, Utah on 17 January 1889, 
			the sixth of seven children born to Marion Haws Holdaway and 
			Prudence Eliza Peay. Brother brothers and sisters were Clara, Frank, 
			Albert, Florence, Lida, and Jennie. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Our home was located in the middle of the block 
			on First South, between 5th and 6th West in Provo. It was a white 
			frame home just across the street from the Pioneer Park. I enjoyed 
			playing ball games at the park and the band concerts that were held 
			on Sunday. We had a large variety of fresh vegetables from our 
			garden that Father planted each year. We lived there until I was ten 
			years old and I went to the Franklin School. I started in the first 
			grade and got whooping cough and had to stay out of school for a 
			long time. We used slates to write on. They were about 10 inches by 
			12 inches and looked like a blackboard. We used chalk to write on 
			them. We used coal-oil lamps for light.
<o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We were alone most of the time for Father 
			worked in the mine in Eureka. Mother, Jennie and I went up on the 
			train to stay with him once. It must have been hard on him to work 
			all day in the mine and then get his own supper. He worked for ten 
			or twelve years in the mines. Father bought property for a farm in 
			Vineyard within a mile east of Utah Lake. He transformed the 
			sagebrush land into a bounteous farm of all kinds of fruits, berries 
			and vegetables. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Father hired a rig from Victor Andersen to dig 
			a well. Then he planted a beautiful hedge of lilacs along the lane 
			in front of our home. Flowers of many varieties and grass surrounded 
			the two-story house. South of the house was a beautiful grove of 
			trees through which a creek flowed. Many native blue-racer snakes 
			made their home there. There was a grape-arbor leading out South to 
			the chicken-coop. It was a beautiful home with all the lovely 
			flowers, green grass, tall trees and delicious fresh fruits and 
			vegetables to enjoy. We had hard winters and we spent many hours of 
			enjoyment skating on the nearby ponds. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes we would skate on Utah Lake and some 
			of the Vineyard boys would skate all the way across the Lake. It was 
			dangerous because of the huge cracks that were sometimes several 
			feet across. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We attended school in a one-room building 
			across the street east of where the Geneva Steel Plant is now 
			located. We had to walk two miles to and from school and to Church 
			which was across the street from the school. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">In my courting days, I loved to dance and had 
			many enjoyable times at the old Geneva Resort. Trips across the Lake 
			on the launch on moonlit nights highlighted my courting days. We 
			danced and sang and had lunch before our return trip. We enjoyed our 
			family life together. Florence and I were particularly close. We 
			used to sing together. She would sing lead and I would harmonize. We 
			sang for many of our ward activities. Some of our favorite songs 
			were: Moonlight and Roses, I'll take you Home again Kathleen, Carry 
			Me back to Old Virginia, My Wild Irish Rose, and The Longest Way 
			Round, is the Sweetest way Home. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">There was no schooling beyond the eighth grade 
			available near-by so I took the eighth grade over again. This gave 
			me a good background in English Grammar, Spelling, and Mathematics 
			that enabled me to help my children in later years. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">One day, while visiting Aunt Rose, my Mother's 
			sister in Benjamin, I met a handsome young man – James Earl Wall. He 
			came to visit me several times in Vineyard. About the same time, one 
			of the handsome young men in the Ward – Thomas Joe Bunnell started 
			courting me. He came with his horse and buggy and we went for rides. 
			What a sight it was to see him coming in his fancy yellow buggy with 
			his price high stepping horse. We courted for four years off and on. <o:p></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I went to Idaho Falls and worked in a candy 
			store for a year. I lived with my sister Lida during this time. I 
			stayed there about a year then I came home. Joel had been released 
			from the Central States Mission on 12 March 1908 because of 
			Rheumatism. He's had his tonsils out by slicing out a little at a 
			time while he was in Texas on his mission. He was sick all the time 
			and had to be released. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We were married about three months after I came 
			home from Idaho. We went along by train to Salt Lake to be married 
			in the Temple. We were married 5 October 1910. My wedding gown was 
			white satin. I kept it for many years but somehow, it got lost when 
			we moved up from Grandma's after Joel died in 1940. It was made in 
			narrow, straight lines, with long sleeves and pleats around the 
			bottom. The train stopped above Emma and Jim's where our friends put 
			us in a buggy and shivareed us with tin cans. We stayed at Mother's 
			that night. Joel's folks gave us a reception at their home. We lived 
			with Joel's folks for a few months until we built our own home. My 
			father and Joel, together with some friends, built our first home. 
			It was located about ½ mile North of his parent's home up on the 
			hill. It was just two rooms built of white brick. Joel's father died 
			in July of 1911 with ulcers. Shortly after, we sold our home and 
			moved in with Grandma. We lived together for a few months while 
			Grandma's house was being built. We took possession 1 January 1915. <o:p></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">My first son was born 22 November 1911. We 
			named him Joel Dean. He was born at Mother's house. Dr. Westwood 
			came out from Provo on the train. My sister, Jennie met him with the 
			horse and a little bobsled. My baby was born in the morning. I was 
			in bed for about two weeks recuperating. He was such a pretty baby 
			with dark curly hair and hazel eyes. He was as good baby. I had so 
			much milk, Joel's cousin, Ellen Bunnel, asked me to feed her baby, 
			Elwin, because she was unable to. They were both healthy babies and 
			thrived on my milk. Grace was born 17 April 1913. She was born at 
			the old house. Jesse Emery was born 3 February 1915 and Neal Eugene 
			was born almost exactly two years later on 2 February 1917. Mary Eva 
			was born on Christmas Eve on 24 December 1919. Lothield (later 
			legally changed to Margie) was born 5 May 1922, Helen – 17 August 
			1926, and Dell LeRoy on 27 September 1928. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We all had to work very hard on our thirty-acre 
			farm. It was difficult to do everything that had to be done. We had 
			three or four cows most of the time. I had to separate the milk 
			every morning. We raised our own pigs and chickens. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">On the east part of the farm, the ground was 
			rocky. We planted fruit trees and berries there. We had an orchard 
			of Cherry trees for fifteen years and it never did bear fruit. The 
			old grove of trees where Joel's father had his packing shed was 
			dynamited out in about 1932. This gave us more land to plant berries 
			on. There was a cold spring of water in the grove of trees. I used 
			to keep my butter wrapped in a wet cloth near this cool water to 
			keep it fresh. Our house was always cool because of the high 
			ceilings and 52 trees Joel's father had planted around it. There 
			were Ash, Maple, White Birch, and Tree of Heaven. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">To keep the pork from spoiling, we would put 
			the pork in a brine made of salt and water strong enough to float an 
			egg. West of the house was rich, brown soil. Joel rotated crops to 
			enrich the soil. We raised Tomatoes, Cantaloupe, Watermelon, 
			Carrots, Potatoes – all good things for a garden; Corn, Cucumbers, 
			Beets, Onions, String Beans, Peppers, Lettuce, Turnips, and Peaches, 
			Pears, Plums, Apples, and Grapes. We worked so hard. Our day would 
			start very early. During the berry season, we'd get up at 4:30 so as 
			to get as much done as possible before the hot sun. It was so cold 
			that early, with the cold canyon breeze, your hands would be too 
			stiff to pick very quickly. But before long, the kids would be 
			praying for rain to cool them off. One morning, Neal curled up in 
			the middle of a wide row of Raspberries, pulled up his old brown 
			coat over his ears and went back to sleep. It wasn't long until he 
			came screaming to the house for someone had found his secret hiding 
			place and doused him with water. After the fruit was all picked, 
			Joel would begin loading the truck. He would take a couple of the 
			children and head up the canyon for Heber, Park City or Kamas to 
			peddle the fruit – house to house: “Would you like any nice fresh 
			fruit today?”, the children would ask. For lunch, we'd buy sweet 
			rolls, cheese, and milk. How delicious that would taste. We'd stay 
			until the load was all gone. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I cooked on a coal range. It was big and black. 
			We polished it with a stove blackening. Every so often the soot that 
			collected under the oven would have to be burned out. We'd crumple a 
			piece of newspaper up and push it into the hole under the oven, then 
			set it afire. The soot would catch fire and go up the chimney in big 
			chunks. The ashes would have to be taken out almost every day. 
			Kindling and coal would have to be brought in and stacked by the 
			stove each night. The fire died down at night and the house was 
			cold. Designs of ice would be all over the windows in the morning. 
			New fires would have to be made every morning. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We had an unusual farm because of the different 
			soil of various types. The upper part, being rocky, was good to grow 
			fruit and berries. Around the house, the soil was rich for garden 
			vegetables. Down below was a sand hill where the hay completed with 
			the sand burrs for survival. How the kids hated to ride the wagon 
			and tromp the hay with all those sand burrs. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Grandma Bunnell used to say this hill, where 
			all the sand burrs grew, was an old Indian Burial Ground. She used 
			to watch the Indians in their ceremonial dances. Below the sand 
			burrs was pastureland. At one time, Joel tried to drain it. He 
			worked so hard putting in a drain down through that clay soil. He 
			dug it about six feet deep. It worked pretty well. He was able to 
			plant and raise some good celery there. He put a cement ditch all 
			the way down south of the pasture to carry water to the young Peach 
			trees he planted on the sand hill. They never seemed to get enough 
			water to survive. They never did produce. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">The children found many arrowheads on the sand 
			hill. In our earlier years, we were quite well to do. We got our 
			first car in 1911. It was the very first one in Vineyard. My, but 
			Joel was proud. He was a very handsome young man. Always neat and 
			clean – a real dandy. We worked very hard. We'd get up with the sun 
			and go to bed early. We lived and worked the same hours as the 
			chickens as it was expensive to stay up and use a lamp. <o:p></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We had to pay $300 to get electricity to the 
			house from Vicklunds. We had a radio when they first came out. 
			Before that, we had an old Victorola record player. During the First 
			World War, prices went up on sugar and flour very high. The 
			depression years were hard. Even though we all worked very hard, 
			sometimes we'd get an early frost that would take practically 
			everything. We'd save our own cantaloupe seed and mellow seed to 
			plant the next year. Frequently we'd have to borrow to buy seeds and 
			plants for the coming year. For a short time, we were forced to 
			accept welfare assistance, although we found this most difficult to 
			do. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We helped make mattresses by going down to the 
			old Vineyard school and pounded the cotton into the ticking, then 
			sewed it up with heavy cord. To pay for the kid's lunches, we sent 
			milk or gave potatoes for pay. Bit by bit, we began losing our farm. 
			We sold a little slice off to Noal Ferry, then a little more and 
			more, until the North property line was just twenty feed from the 
			house. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Joel was in poor health at this time and was 
			getting sicker. We traded what was left of the farm and the house to 
			LaVon Vernon for the property where I live now. There was an old 
			station house they had hauled in from Soldiers Summit. It was a 
			miserable old house, cold, rickity and smelly. We moved in about 
			1938. It was still cold weather. It was about in March, Helen got 
			pleurisy from the cold draught sleeping on the floor the first 
			night. She sang the lead in the Jr. High School Operetta: “Lady of 
			the Terrace”, the day we moved in. We tried planting tomatoes, but 
			the cutworms ate them off as soon as we planted. The soil was 
			run-down and poor. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Joel kept getting sicker. He filled up with 
			water and had “Dropsy”. As the summer wore on, he got weaker and 
			weaker. He died on 31st of October 1940. (In his 54th year.) <o:p></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I went down to live with Mother. I worked for 
			the school lunch for a while. Then I washed windows out at the steel 
			plant. I made some wonderful friends. Then I sewed slipcovers for 
			Dixon Taylor Russel in Provo. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">Early in November 1942, I wrote this letter to 
			my daughter Grace: “I can't tell you how surprised I was when Earl 
			came to see me. My old sweetheart has come back. When I got home 
			Saturday night, Earl was waiting to see me and Norma had asked him 
			to stay Sunday, so he did. He said he was divorced a month ago. He 
			got up and made both fires, took ashes out and dressed Kay and 
			Ronald. Your mother is going to marry the most honorable man in the 
			world. We would have been married today on Jess's and Grandma 
			Holdaway's wedding day, but we'll have to wait five months. Well, 
			it's Thanksgiving and my heart's so full of thankfulness it's about 
			to burst. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">There's one thing I'm thankful for, as bad as I 
			want him that we couldn't get married. We'll have another test to 
			prove our strength and when we do get married, we'll know we can 
			trust each other to the end of the earth if need be. Another thing 
			I'm thankful for is that he came while Grandma Bunnell was still 
			here. I took him over last night and told her the most wonderful 
			love story she had ever heard and someday maybe I'll tell it to the 
			world. I told her Earl would love to call her mother if she would 
			let him and we were going to do all we could to make her life the 
			happiest she has ever known. She said she was glad I had come and 
			talked to her and wants us to come as much as we can, which of 
			course we'll do. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">There's another thing I'm thankful for, and I 
			guess you'll laugh at it, and that is that he came before my hair 
			all turned gray. I guess you'll say to yourself: “What made her 
			think he'd come?” Well, it's this: I always felt that if I lived a 
			good, clean life and raised my family the same way, this happiness 
			would come to me. And when we shook hands, we both knew it had, but 
			he didn't even kiss me till the next day. He knew how I felt towards 
			him. Then, when I was in his arms, for which I had waited so long, 
			he kissed the tears away. When I danced with him the other night, I 
			felt like I could dance through life with him. He's only been here a 
			little over a week and we have been to two dances and to church. 
			They hold church conjointly at the Scera and there was a man there 
			who was the President of the European Mission at the outbreak of the 
			war. He gave one of the most wonderful talks I have ever heard. He 
			visits the camps where our boys are. One night, there was only one 
			left in camp and he asked where the others were? He said they had 
			gone to the other end of town for a night of revelry. “Why didn't 
			you go?” the speaker asked. He said: “I have just received a letter 
			from my dad telling how he believed in me and trusted me and do you 
			think I could go after that?” He said how important it is that we 
			write letters to the boys whether they belong to us or not. <o:p></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We are going to church every Sunday and I am 
			going to pay tithing. Then we are going to another honorable man, 
			Bishop Gappmeyer, and ask for a recommend. How I wish that all of 
			you could go through the temple with us. There'll be five months to 
			prepare and I don't see why you can't. How thankful I am that I have 
			been so my girls could come to me with their problems. There's no 
			one in the world that has more to be thankful for that I have today. 
			To think that I could go through life with two handsome men loving 
			me and another good thing about it is that they resemble each other, 
			having the same blue eyes. Grandma Bunnell said so last night. 
			Sunday, Helen was combing my hair by the window and he had gone and 
			gotten in the truck. As he drove by I said “Oh, Helen, Look!” He 
			looked so much like Pop I had to cry. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">I've made the footprints for you children to 
			step in and I don't think you have missed many. If this letter will 
			be the means of living so you can get a recommend, I will be the 
			happiest person in the world. How I wish I had been more pleasant 
			and given you the love you craved. I'm going to try to make up to my 
			grandchildren what I didn't give my children. And whatever time and 
			money I have, I'm going to use to try to make someone happy. I can't 
			help but feel there has been a higher power than ours that has had a 
			hand in shaping our lives.. . . Earl and I were married 10 May 1942. <o:p></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">We were happy together. We went on some nice 
			trips together. One we went on was to the Northwest. Earl's children 
			went with us. We went up the Columbia River. Saw beautiful country. 
			Earl loved to fish. I learned to fish with him. Earl loved horses. 
			He liked me to go riding with him. Earl died suddenly of a massive 
			heart attack on 23 March 1961. Since then, I have been lost. 
			Suddenly I was left alone. All my children were married and gone. I 
			went into shock and depression after Earl left me. <o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">The children arranged to have a new house built 
			for me in place of the old one. I have tried to find something to 
			interest me, something to do to make someone happy. I have always 
			said, “If I can't do something for someone else, I don't want to 
			live!” I'm all alone now, Grace Nuttal has been living with me for 
			four years but she has gone to live in California now. I don't seem 
			to have anything to live for. I don't know why I can't go! (Helen’s 
			comments: Mama passed away apparently quietly in her sleep sometime 
			the night of 3 August 1967. We all became alarmed when we couldn't 
			get her by phone. Neal and Joe found her. She lived such a good 
			life. She worked so hard always thinking of someone else instead of 
			her own wants, needs or desires. She was completely unselfish. Her 
			wants were little. She lived as the Savior taught: “For inasmuch as 
			ye have done it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye have done 
			it unto me.” May she be at peace and receive eternal joy and 
			happiness which she so justly deserves. We all loved her so.... and 
			cherish our sweet memories. . Her melodious voice. . . her smile . . 
			. the twinkle in her eye as she watched her grandchildren toddle 
			across the floor, or come running to her . . arms outstretched. God

			<p class="auto-style104"><span class="auto-style98">My Mother My 
			Mother’s maiden name is Helen Bunnell. She was born August 17, 1926. 
			Her Mother was Zelda Holdaway and her Father was Joel Bunnell. My 
			Mother is a physically beautiful and extremely creative and talented 
			woman. She is the Mother of nine children. <o:p></o:p>
			</span></p>
			<p class="auto-style104"><span class="auto-style98">
			<o:p>She is very musical and has performed in 
			numerous musical productions and operas as a leading lady singing 
			soprano. I remember in my youth when she performed the leading 
			female role in productions of Madame Butterfly and La Bohemme 
			produced by the Utah Valley Opera Association. I fondly remember the 
			songs from these operas and others, still. There is something really 
			beautiful and unique about Puccini’s music. I remember a lot of 
			music that my parents enjoyed in our home during my youth. When I 
			was young, Rogers and Hammerstein and other musicals were at the 
			height of their popularity. The music from these productions such as 
			South Pacific, Oklahoma, Kismet, Music Man, West Side Story, The 
			King and I, The Sound of Music, and others were an important part of 
			my youth. My Mother and Father loved music, operas, musicals, and 
			everything associated with these experiences. Music permeated our 
			home.</o:p></span></p>
			<p class="auto-style104">
			<o:p><span class="auto-style98">My Mother sang at hundreds, if not thousands of 
			events from weddings to funerals, to church meetings and private 
			parties, especially during my youth. It seemed to me that she was 
			continually singing or preparing to sing somewhere. I remember that 
			sometime in the late fifties or early sixties she was asked to join 
			a singing group called the Singing Mothers, to travel to England to 
			perform as representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
			Day Saints, at various locations there. I remember that she took a 
			silent movie camera with her and she still has these movies that we 
			see on occasion. Later she joined the Tabernacle Choir and sang with 
			that prestigious group for several years, during which time, she 
			also traveled to a number of places around the world to perform with 
			the Choir. <o:p></o:p>
			</span></o:p>
			</p>
			<p class="auto-style104">
			<o:p>
			<o:p><span class="auto-style98">I remember my Mother as a very loving, 
			nurturing and committed Mother. I have always felt her love and her 
			devotion. She is an emotionally intense person with a very strong 
			and dominant personality. You would never accuse her of being timid. 
			She loved to perform and provided a very good example to her 
			children to feel free to get up in front of large or small groups to 
			perform without any kind of fear. We got lots of opportunities to do 
			so in our family. I remember one period of time during my teenage 
			years when my Mother decided to put together a small family 
			production of The Sound of Music with my Mother playing the role of 
			the governess, as played by Julie Andrews in the movie version. My 
			Father played the role of the Father, Captain VonTrapp and each of 
			us children would play the roles of the VonTrapp children. We took 
			this little play around the community and performed it for various 
			private parties and community events. I remember that I sang “I Am 
			Sixteen Going On Seventeen” as a duet with my sister Melody in this 
			production. We also sang a song called “Doe a Dear, A Female Dear”, 
			and others.</span></o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="auto-style104">
			<o:p>
			<o:p><span class="auto-style98">My Mother always did things in a big way. When 
			she cooked, she cooked in quantity. When she sewed, she sewed in 
			quantity. When she sang, she did it in a big way. Everything with 
			her was always pretty intense. No one that ever met her would ever 
			forget her. She had a unique personality that was strong, 
			passionate, and unmistakable. She was and is a committed Mother that 
			is eternally and unconditionally bound to her children. She is 
			loving and spiritually sensitive. She is drawn to the light, but has 
			been frustrated in her search for it. She will ultimately find it. I 
			love her. </span></o:p>

				<p>
				<img alt="" src="1949-08-08DAD&BabySkip.jpg" height="821" width="571" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="auto-style104">My Father’s name is Clyde Everett Weeks, 
				Jr. He was born in Manila, The Philippines on November 18,1925. 
				His Father’s name is Clyde Everett Weeks and his Mother’s name 
				is Bertha Margarita Larsen. The reason that my Father was born 
				in the Philippines is that his Father was serving in the United 
				States army at that time. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="auto-style104">Shortly after my Father’s birth, his family 
				moved to Utah where his Father was stationed at Fort Douglas, 
				near the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. So, I guess that 
				you could call my Dad an army brat. He tells us interesting 
				stories of his life at Fort Douglas where he learned to catch 
				trout with his bare hands and take hikes up on Red Butte, behind 
				Fort Douglas. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="auto-style104">His Mother died when he was just 16 and is 
				buried in the Fort Douglas cemetery. Her grave is located in the 
				north east corner of the cemetery, should you want to go there 
				some time to see it. It is a small, peaceful place. You should 
				go there sometime to see the place. My Dad tells a story of when 
				he was an infant and still living in the Philippines. He was 
				crawling around in the back yard when his nanny was babysitting 
				him one day. A large python snake came over the fence and 
				approached him. As he tells the story, the baby sitter saved him 
				from death just in the nick of time. I’m glad he lived through 
				that one. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="auto-style104">My Father is a poet and a writer. He has 
				written for newspapers for my entire life. He has written poems, 
				even longer. He loves to write poems using iambic pentameter and 
				you can always tell when he’s working on a new one, because he 
				will be carrying a yellow legal pad of paper around with him and 
				silently counting out the metre on the fingers of his hand. He 
				has written poems on every conceivable subject you can imagine: 
				from death, to marriage to Skippy Peanut Butter. That’s right, 
				Skippy Peanut Butter. A year or two ago, he noted how much he 
				enjoyed this brand of peanut butter and decided to write a poem 
				about it. After he finished the poem, he liked it so much that 
				he decided to send it to the company, so that they could enjoy 
				it too. And you’ll never guess what happened. They sent him a 
				letter thanking him for his kindness and included a lifetime 
				supply of coupons for him to get free peanut butter. <o:p></o:p>
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style104">Incidentally, I was called Skippy Peanut 
				Butter during my youth. I hated it when my friends did this but 
				I guess that I would have done the same, if they had been called 
				“Skippy Weeks”. It would have been just too tempting. <o:p></o:p>
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style104">He has always been a wonderful example to 
				his family to never be afraid to promote yourself. He has used 
				some pretty creative approaches throughout his life to promote 
				himself and his family. He once ran for Mayor of Orem. He served 
				on the Orem City Council, the SCERA Board of Directors and as 
				the Postmaster of Orem for 40 years. While he was Postmaster, he 
				ended up building two new Post Offices, as the city continually 
				grew to outstrip each previous building. He retired a few years 
				ago and has since then been free to spend more time with each of 
				his children. <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="auto-style104">My Father served in the U.S. Marines in 
				World War II. I don’t know much about his experience in this 
				terrible conflict, other than that he was awarded the Purple 
				Heart for acting with valor and being seriously wounded. His leg 
				was permanently damaged by an exploding hand granade. The wound 
				almost blew off his foot and the lower part of his leg. He never 
				talks about it but bears it with courage. The wound destroyed 
				the tendons and ligaments in the front of his lower leg, making 
				it impossible for him to lift his foot up. For years he wore a 
				spring-loaded brace on this foot that would keep his foot in the 
				raised position so that he would not trip over it. Within the 
				last few years he has stopped wearing the brace and seems to be 
				able to walk without any noticeable difficulty. Perhaps the 
				surrounding muscles have strengthened to enable him to avoid the 
				brace. I can’t imagine what a sacrifice this must have caused 
				him over the years. In spite of this serious handicap he has 
				always been active and helpful in lots of physical things that 
				needed to be done around the house. My hat’s off to you Dad for 
				your courage! <o:p></o:p></p>
				<p class="auto-style104">He has written a column called originally 
				“This Weeks’ Wit” or more recently “Under Timpanogos Green”. 
				These articles chronicle his perspectives about life and his 
				community. This creative outlet has been a gift of love from my 
				Dad to his community. He has always loved Orem and I’m sure he 
				always will. Dad is a loving Father. He has always been loyally 
				committed to the health and well-being of his wife and each of 
				his children. He has always worked hard to provide financially 
				for his family and been a wonderful example of constancy, amid 
				the uncertainty of the world around us. I love him.<o:p></o:p></p>

					Love in Family I was preceded by an older sister, April 
					Melody. Being the oldest son in the family was interesting. 
					I think that over time, I came to resent the large numbers 
					of siblings that followed, but not deeply. I think that it 
					just caused me to be more independent. I know that my 
					younger brothers and sisters looked up to me and loved me, 
					as much as brothers and sisters can love one another. I 
					should probably explain this comment. There are all kinds of 
					love within families. The strongest love exists from Mothers 
					and Fathers to their children. I think probably the most 
					powerful is that of Mother to child. This, because of the 
					personal, physical sacrifice and nurturing that is unique to 
					a Mother/child relationship. A different kind of love from 
					parent-&gt;child love is husband/wife - wife-husband love. This 
					may be stronger or weaker than parent-&gt;child love, depending 
					upon the circumstances. It is, however, completely different 
					in its nature. The least powerful bond in a family is that 
					between sibling children, I think, because all children are 
					ultimately competing for family resources of love and goods. 
					Each child shares a common connection to the same parents 
					but they may or may not share a common bond of love with 
					each other. However, in ideal families they will, through 
					active example and intervention by their parents. Love is a 
					most interesting word. It means so many different things to 
					each person that says it. In some ways I would prefer to not 
					use this word, because of the potential for confusion. 
					Almost any other word will more accurately communicate true 
					meaning better than the word “love”. In its highest and best 
					form, Agape, Chistlike, godly, selfless, unconditional, 
					commitment, attraction, and devotion to another, love is the 
					finest emotion and state of relationship that can exist. 
					This is rarely what is experienced or meant by individuals 
					when they say that they feel love for another.</p>

										My Father’s Mother’s brother named

										He was married to Edna Scorrup. This 
										couple, Aunt Edna and Uncle Wilford were 
										a lifelong example of what attentive, 
										loving relatives should be. They always 
										joined us every Christmas morning. We 
										visited their home at least monthly. 
										They lived on 1200 South Street in Orem

										an orchard filled with bing cherries and 
										a few tart cooking cherries.</p>

										I remember fondly, and sometimes not so 
										fondly, picking cherries and working for 
										Uncle Wilford. I had strong allergies 
										which caused me to get a bad case of hay 
										fever, each and every summer. I always 
										loved the summertime, but it always 
										meant that I would be sneezing. I also 
										think that I was sometimes allergic to

										work at the hands of a loving and 
										objective uncle.</p>

										My aunt Edna died first, which left 
										uncle Wilford to live alone. He found a 
										nice woman named, Ruby whom he later 
										married. He sold his farm and moved 
										across the street, where he lived until 
										he died.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										I remember that we were living in San 
										Diego, when he died. We came up to Utah 
										to visit a year or two before he died 
										and I went over to visit him. He was out 
										sweeping his driveway when I arrived and 
										I was able to visit with him. As we 
										talked I was able to thank him for his 
										great example of love and concern over 
										the years as I was growing up. I can 
										still see the look on his face as his 
										eyes filled with tears. I’m glad that I 
										had the chance to tell him thank you for 
										his love, before he died.</p>

										My Mother had brothers and sisters. Her 
										sisters were Margie, Eva, and Grace. Her 
										brothers were Jesse, Neal, and Dell. We 
										were closest to the families of Eva, 
										Neal and Dell because they lived closest 
										to us. Jesse lived in Idaho Falls with 
										his wife Carma. Grace and my Mother 
										never seemed to be that close, so we 
										didn’t spend much time there.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										Dell was married to LaVerne and they had 
										a son named Tommy, who was my age. He 
										and I always had sleep-overs, where 
										either I would sleep at his house for 
										the week-end or he would sleep at my 
										house. We had lots of fun. They lived in 
										the Grandview area in north Provo, and 
										we played all over that area. He had two 
										younger brothers named Randy and Greg, 
										and two or three sisters. Both Tommy and 
										Greg committed suicide in their 
										twenties. By the way, Neal and Norma 
										also had a child named Kay who also 
										committed suicide in his late forties or 
										early fifties, and Eva and Jay had a son 
										named Ronnie who died in the Colorado 
										river. They found his body miles down 
										shore a few days later. I remember 
										Ronnie was honored for saving someone 
										from a fire, as a Boy Scout in his early 
										teens.</p>

										My Dad helped my Mother get out of the 
										car with my new little brother, wrapped 
										up in lots of blankets. I don’t remember 
										why this impression has stayed with me 
										but I remember it quite vividly. My 
										parents must have tried to make it a

										They seem to always be peaceful, happy,

										and brought a chicken that they had 
										raised for dinner. The only problem was

										My Aunts &amp; Uncles - When I think of my 
										aunts and uncles I remember my Father’s 
										brother Michael and his sister Sharee. 
										Mike was in the U.S. Air Force, as a 
										pilot. He was married to a woman named 
										Shirley. They later divorced, when Mike 
										met a woman named Seija, I believe from 
										Norway, in his travels. I remember 
										visiting with Mike at Shirley’s parents 
										home, when Mike was in town from his 
										training or traveling. As of 2017, Mike 
										lives in Florida with his wife, Donna.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										Sharee is my Father’s sister. She had 
										several children. She was married to a 
										man named Keith Smith, who worked as a 
										printer at the BYU print shop. He died 
										several years ago. She had health many 
										health problems. My memories of her in 
										person are very positive. She was always 
										very kind to me.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										My Father’s Mother’s brother named 
										Wilford Larsen was one of my favorite 
										uncles or more accurately Great uncles. 
										He was married to Edna Scorrup. This 
										couple, Aunt Edna and Uncle Wilford were 
										a lifelong example of what attentive, 
										loving relatives should be. They always 
										joined us every Christmas morning. We 
										visited their home at least monthly. 
										They lived on 1200 South Street in Orem 
										and about 200 East. They had a big barn 
										out back of their house, a tractor, and 
										an orchard filled with bing cherries and 
										a few tart cooking cherries.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										I remember fondly, and sometimes not so 
										fondly, picking cherries and working for 
										Uncle Wilford. I had strong allergies 
										which caused me to get a bad case of hay 
										fever, each and every summer. I always 
										loved the summertime, but it always 
										meant that I would be sneezing. I also 
										think that I was sometimes allergic to 
										work, as well. I’m grateful for these 
										experiences where I first learned to 
										work at the hands of a loving and 
										objective uncle.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										My aunt Edna died first, which left 
										uncle Wilford to live alone. He found a 
										nice woman named, Ruby whom he later 
										married. He sold his farm and moved 
										across the street, where he lived until 
										he died.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										I remember that we were living in San 
										Diego, when he died. We came up to Utah 
										to visit a year or two before he died 
										and I went over to visit him. He was out 
										sweeping his driveway when I arrived and 
										I was able to visit with him. As we 
										talked I was able to thank him for his 
										great example of love and concern over 
										the years as I was growing up. I can 
										still see the look on his face as his 
										eyes filled with tears. I’m glad that I 
										had the chance to tell him thank you for 
										his love, before he died.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										My Mother had brothers and sisters. Her 
										sisters were Margie, Eva, and Grace. Her 
										brothers were Jesse, Neal, and Dell. We 
										were closest to the families of Eva, 
										Neal and Dell because they lived closest 
										to us. Jesse lived in Idaho Falls with 
										his wife Carma. Grace and my Mother 
										never seemed to be that close, so we 
										didn’t spend much time there.</p>
										<p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em; color: rgb(115, 115, 115); font-family: &quot;PT Serif&quot;, serif;">
										Dell was married to LaVerne and they had 
										a son named Tommy, who was my age. He 
										and I always had sleep-overs, where 
										either I would sleep at his house for 
										the week-end or he would sleep at my 
										house. We had lots of fun. They lived in 
										the Grandview area in north Provo, and 
										we played all over that area. He had two 
										younger brothers named Randy and Greg, 
										and two or three sisters. Both Tommy and 
										Greg committed suicide in their 
										twenties. By the way, Neal and Norma 
										also had a child named Kay who also 
										committed suicide in his late forties or 
										early fifties, and Eva and Jay had a son 
										named Ronnie who died in the Colorado 
										river. They found his body miles down 
										shore a few days later. I remember 
										Ronnie was honored for saving someone 
										from a fire, as a Boy Scout in his early 
										teens.</p>

										but I remember it quite vividly. My

										My family was very active in the Church 
										of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or 
										the Mormon Church during my youth and 
										today each of my brothers and sisters 
										still actively practice this faith. My 
										Mother’s family has always been members 
										of the church since its inception in the 
										early 1800s and my Father’s family was 
										converted to the church after my 
										paternal Grandfather moved to Utah. He 
										later served as Bishop in Provo and in 
										other positions of responsibility in the 
										church. My Father also served as Bishop 
										of a BYU ward.</p>

										I am grateful for my heritage. I know 
										that my ancestors were noble people with 
										many talents and skills that I have been 
										blessed by. I only pray that I can add 
										to the luster of this rich legacy, as I 
										live my life. I hope that my descendants 
										will look back to what I have done, as 
										an example of how it should be done. I 
										have tried to live my life true to my 
										inner voice and principles of truth.</p>

										One day my grandparents came over for 
										dinner at the old house on Center street 
										and brought a chicken that they had 
										raised for dinner. The only problem was 
										that it had not yet been plucked. All 
										the feathers were still intact. Grampa 
										took care of the bulk of the work but I 
										remember seeing the chicken and being 
										able to pull out a few of the feathers. 
										I think that if we now had to go through 
										this tedium every time we wanted to eat 
										chicken, there wouldn’t be any chicken 
										served. Isn’t automation and commercial 
										food preparation great!</p>

			My Aunts &amp; Uncles - When I think of my aunts and uncles I remember 
			my Father’s brother Michael and his sister Sharee. Mike was in the 
			U.S. Air Force, as a pilot. He was married to a woman named Shirley. 
			They later divorced, when Mike met a woman named Seija, I believe 
			from Norway, in his travels. I remember visiting with Mike at 
			Shirley’s parents home, when Mike was in town from his training or 
			traveling. As of 2017, Mike lives in Florida with his wife, Donna.</p>

			Sharee is my Father’s sister. She had several children. She was 
			married to a man named Keith Smith, who worked as a printer at the 
			BYU print shop. He died several years ago. She had health many 
			health problems. My memories of her in person are very positive. She 
			was always very kind to me.</p>

			My Father’s Mother’s brother named Wilford Larsen was one of my 
			favorite uncles or more accurately Great uncles. He was married to 
			Edna Scorrup. This couple, Aunt Edna and Uncle Wilford were a 
			lifelong example of what attentive, loving relatives should be. They 
			always joined us every Christmas morning. We visited their home at 
			least monthly. They lived on 1200 South Street in Orem and about 200 
			East. They had a big barn out back of their house, a tractor, and an 
			orchard filled with bing cherries and a few tart cooking cherries.</p>

			I remember fondly, and sometimes not so fondly, picking cherries and 
			working for Uncle Wilford. I had strong allergies which caused me to 
			get a bad case of hay fever, each and every summer. I always loved 
			the summertime, but it always meant that I would be sneezing. I also 
			think that I was sometimes allergic to work, as well. I’m grateful 
			for these experiences where I first learned to work at the hands of 
			a loving and objective uncle.</p>

			My aunt Edna died first, which left uncle Wilford to live alone. He 
			found a nice woman named, Ruby whom he later married. He sold his 
			farm and moved across the street, where he lived until he died.</p>

			I remember that we were living in San Diego, when he died. We came 
			up to Utah to visit a year or two before he died and I went over to 
			visit him. He was out sweeping his driveway when I arrived and I was 
			able to visit with him. As we talked I was able to thank him for his 
			great example of love and concern over the years as I was growing 
			up. I can still see the look on his face as his eyes filled with 
			tears. I’m glad that I had the chance to tell him thank you for his 
			love, before he died.</p>

			My Mother had brothers and sisters. Her sisters were Margie, Eva, 
			and Grace. Her brothers were Jesse, Neal, and Dell. We were closest 
			to the families of Eva, Neal and Dell because they lived closest to 
			us. Jesse lived in Idaho Falls with his wife Carma. Grace and my 
			Mother never seemed to be that close, so we didn’t spend much time 
			there.</p>

			Dell was married to LaVerne and they had a son named Tommy, who was 
			my age. He and I always had sleep-overs, where either I would sleep 
			at his house for the week-end or he would sleep at my house. We had 
			lots of fun. They lived in the Grandview area in north Provo, and we 
			played all over that area. He had two younger brothers named Randy 
			and Greg, and two or three sisters. Both Tommy and Greg committed 
			suicide in their twenties. By the way, Neal and Norma also had a 
			child named Kay who also committed suicide in his late forties or 
			early fifties, and Eva and Jay had a son named Ronnie who died in 
			the Colorado river. They found his body miles down shore a few days 
			later. I remember Ronnie was honored for saving someone from a fire, 
			as a Boy Scout in his early teens.</p>

			MAY 1953 - One of the first memories that I recall, is sharing a 
			picnic with a little friend of mine, named Eric Fielding. Eric and I 
			asked my Mother to prepare a lunch for us, which included a quart 
			jar of grape juice and hard- boiled eggs.</p>

			We took this lunch out on the front lawn, where we feasted together 
			on a bright spring morning. I can remember the feel of the green 
			grass under us and the warm blue sky above us. This was at our old 
			house on Center Street.</p>

			AUGUST 15, 1953 - I remember the day that my first little brother 
			(Skylar) came home from the hospital. My parents pulled up to the 
			front sidewalk. My Dad jumped out and opened the door for my Mother 
			to get out of her side of the car. I think the car was a Kaiser 
			(what a weird looking car). My Dad helped my Mother get out of the 
			car with my new little brother, wrapped up in lots of blankets. I 
			don’t remember why this impression has stayed with me but I remember 
			it quite vividly. My parents must have tried to make it a special 
			time for us. Bringing new babies home for the first time really is a 
			special experience. Some of my best memories in life surround these 
			events. They seem to always be peaceful, happy, and filled with 
			love.</span>&nbsp;</td>

			<br />
			JULY 1955 - One day my grandparents came over for dinner at the old 
			house on Center street and brought a chicken that they had raised 
			for dinner. The only problem was that it had not yet been plucked. 
			All the feathers were still intact. Grampa took care of the bulk of 
			the work but I remember seeing the chicken and being able to pull 
			out a few of the feathers. I think that if we now had to go through 
			this tedium every time we wanted to eat chicken, there wouldn’t be 
			any chicken served. Isn’t automation and commercial food preparation 
			great!</span>&nbsp;</td>
