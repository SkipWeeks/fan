		<strong>HISTORY OF THOMAS GAMMON AND ELIZABETH DAY <br />
		</strong>At the time of Thomas Gammon's birth, George III was king of 
		England (1760-1820), and James Monroe was President of the United 
		States. England suffered from the worst agricultural conditions after 
		the Battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo in the Napoleonic War. The 
		government was deeply in debt; food prices rose sharply but not wages; 
		there were higher taxes; farm prices fell. Farm workers such as the 
		Gammons were starving. <br />
		<br />
		George IV (1830-1837) during whose reign The Great Reform Bill of 1831 
		was the greatest step towards democracy in England in nearly 600 years. 
		It was an opportune time for the Mormon missionaries who came to England 
		in 1837, for the people were hungry and dissatisfied with their lives 
		and the Church had so much to offer them. <br />
		<br />
		Thomas was born 20 Jun 1819 and christened 27 Jun 1819 in Braunton, 
		Devon. However, he always gave his birth date as 27 Jun 1820, and it was 
		recorded as such in all the records found of him after he came to Utah 
		-- Provo Ward Records, records kept by the family, obituary, tombstone, 
		etc. <br />
		<br />
		He married Elizabeth (Betsey) Day 27 Oct 1840. She was born 10 Apr 1817, 
		Petrockstow, Devon, the daughter of Henry Day and Elizabeth. They were 
		an aristocratic and wealthy family. Thomas and Elizabeth met when Thomas 
		came to work for Mr. Day as a gardener. The parents felt their daughter 
		was too good to marry a farm boy and told Betsey she would lose her 
		inheritance if she married Thomas. This did not change their minds as 
		they loved each other and eloped. Thomas could work no longer on the Day 
		Estate, and so the young couple had to leave. Just where they lived the 
		first years after their marriage is not known. <br />
		<br />
		Charles, their first child, was born in Devonshire 27 Apr 1842. They 
		were living in Neath, Glamorgan, Wales, at the time their second son, 
		William, was born 26 Jul 1845. They were also living in Wales when they 
		joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas was 
		baptized 21 Dec 1847 and Elizabeth a year later on 15 Dec 1848. The 
		first LDS Conference was created in Wales in 1844. <br />
		<br />
		The headquarters of the British Mission was in Liverpool, and it was the 
		place of embarkation of nearly all the Latter-day Saints leaving for 
		America--not only the British but the Scandinavians and other Europeans. 
		Emigrants gathered by the thousands with their own bedding and 
		equipment, including a two-gallon water can for every person, a teapot, 
		a canister for tea and sugar, a frying pan, an iron pot for cooking, 
		plates, cups and bowls, cutlery, and a chamber pot with a cover. 
		Everyone in steerage was expected to do his own food preparation. <br />
		<br />
		There were better accommodations for an extra ten shillings or a pound 
		for those who could afford it. For considerably more money there were 
		staterooms, a spacious living room and abundant food at high prices, 
		with service either from the ship's employees or from emigrant girls 
		eager to earn a little money. The great majority of the Saints traveled 
		in steerage. <br />
		<br />
		Thomas Gammon and Elizabeth left Liverpool, England, 18 Feb 1850 on the 
		ship &quot;Josiah Bradlee&quot;; there were 263 passengers (&quot;Crossing the Ocean 
		1849-1855&quot; 38335 part 3). Charles had died prior to this time as he was 
		not listed on the shipping lists. William was almost five years old. 
		According to shipping lists in the Church Historical Department, the 
		ship arrived in New Orleans 18 Apr 1850, a journey of 59 days. <br />
		<br />
		C. Mansfield was the Master of the ship and T. Day was listed as the 
		company leader. Elder Day writes: &quot;The cooking seemed to try our 
		patience most, but according to the manner in which our company was 
		organized, accompanied with the diligence of the presidents of each 
		section, order and peace prevailed, and the whole company could have tea 
		and be on deck by 6 o'clock when the songs of Zion were sung more or 
		less, which caused cheerfulness to beam on every countenance. Thus were 
		our evenings generally passed until the signal was given for prayers, 
		which were attended to by the presidents of each section at 8 o'clock in 
		the morning and at the same hour in the evening, after which 
		preparations were made for rest. . . There was a church meeting every 
		Sunday, and everyone was given the chance of expressing their feelings 
		about anything they wished.&quot; <br />
		<br />
		After leaving the &quot;Josiah Bradlee&quot; in New Orleans, the passengers took 
		another boat up the Mississippi and, just north of St. Louis, went west 
		on the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where they remained two 
		years before starting the final leg of their journey to Utah. According 
		to Emma Percia Bunnell Blake, a grand-daughter, her grandparents reached 
		Council Bluffs in May 1850 and remained there one year. There they 
		acquired two yoke of oxen and four cows and these made their team while 
		crossing the plains. <br />
		<br />
		They moved from Council Bluffs to Newark, Missouri, where they lived 
		before starting for Utah. They arrived in Provo, Utah, 16 Aug 1853.
		<br />
		<br />
		Following is a copy of the letter Capt. Henry Ettleman wrote to Brigham 
		Young after the wagon train arrived: Devils Gate, August 19, 1853 Pres. 
		Brigham Young, Dear Brother: According to your request, I send the 
		following report. Henry Ettleman, captain, Christenia Ettleman, Moroni 
		Ettleman, Christian Clapper, Margaret Clapper, Joseph Clapper, Mary Ann 
		Clapper, Susan Clapper, Geo. Ettleman, Susan Ettleman, Mary Ellen 
		Ettleman, Hiram Hitchcock, Henry Clapper, Sarah Ann Clapper, Lucy Ann 
		Clapper, Mary Rock, Julia E. Rock, Thos. Gammon, Elizabeth Gammon, Wm. 
		Gammon, John Crumpton, Hannah Crumpton, Margret Emma Crumpton, Robt. 
		Crumpton, Ann Ackerley, Mary Ackerley, Fanny Ackerley, Sarah Ackerley, 
		Robert Singleton, Thos. Jones, Edward Pugh, Mary Pugh, Geo. Williams, 
		Lucy Williams, Ephraim Williams, Enoch Pugh, John Hart, 11 Wagons, 45 
		work oxen, 34 cows, 28 young cattle, 14 horses. (signed) Henry Ettleman, 
		Capt. <br />
		<br />
		Thomas and Elizabeth Gammon brought with them across the plains several 
		window panes, which they used in the home they built later, an adobe 
		mold, a tin lantern, and several pieces of beautiful handwork and things 
		Elizabeth had made. It was said that she liked to sew nice pretty 
		articles but did not mend overalls. Elizabeth also brought her beloved 
		organ; apparently her parents let her take it from the family home. It 
		was a treadle organ and a lovely piece of furniture. She and her 
		daughter Mary Elizabeth, learned to play it when children. She gave it 
		to her son, William, when he got married; and his eldest daughter, Elon, 
		learned to play the organ when she was a child. It was in William's home 
		at the time of his death. <br />
		<br />
		Their first home in Provo was the covered wagon in which they crossed 
		the plains. It was while living here that their last two children were 
		born--Henry Franklin 30 Dec 1854 and Mary Elizabeth 22 Aug 1857, Henry 
		died before the 1860 census was taken, but no date of his death has been 
		found. <br />
		<br />
		It was slow, tedious work to build their home, as Thomas used the adobe 
		mold he brought with him to Utah and he could make only two bricks at a 
		time. His house was the first one in Provo to have glass windows. How 
		they must have looked forward to having a nice, comfortable home. <br />
		<br />
		During their early life in Provo the Church started developing 
		cooperatives with the aim of enabling the people to be their own 
		merchants and share in the profits of business and also to supply their 
		wants. It was boasted that with the event of the railroad Mormonism 
		would be overtaken and Brigham Young would be de-throned and the &quot;old 
		settlers&quot; treated without consideration. Another reason was that 
		individuals had no capital to enter business themselves; many persons 
		with small means united in a cooperative plan. <br />
		<br />
		Connected with this movement was an extension of the effort to restrict 
		Latter-day Saint trading to those of their own confraternity. In the 
		boycott of 1865-66 a distinction had been made between non-Mormon 
		merchants who were hostile to the Latter-day Saints and had joined 
		forces with the anti-Mormon political agitators. But at the October 
		Conference of 1868 this distinction was no longer adhered to; a boycott 
		was urged against all non-Mormons. Steps were taken to make the 
		resolution that the Latter-day Saints be a self-sustaining people. Those 
		inclined to act independently and to trade where they pleased were 
		warned that they could not hope to retain fellowship with the Latter-day 
		Saints if they persisted in that course. Elizabeth Gammon bought sewing 
		materials from a non-Mormon merchant. They were well pleased with the 
		service they received and were treated fairly by the merchant. She 
		continued to buy materials there because she resented the boycott. <br />
		<br />
		When they continued to patronize the store, she and her husband were 
		disfellowshipped 10 Mar 1869 &quot;for apostasy in favor of Josephitism&quot; 
		(Provo 2nd Ward Records). William and Charlotte Gammon were also 
		disfellowshipped 19 Dec 1869 &quot;apostasy in favor of Godbe and Harrison&quot;. 
		Thomas and Elizabeth became bitter toward the Church, but they were 
		later reinstated and remained active. <br />
		<br />
		Thomas Gammon was a polygamist. He was sealed to Sarah Ann Brown 13 Mar 
		1856 by George A. Smith in Provo, Utah in the G. A. Smith house. 
		According to this record she was born Oct 1826, Cooms Morr, 
		Herefordshire, England. The Provo 2nd Ward Records (Film 026324) states 
		she was born 27 Oct 1827, England, the daughter of Thomas Brown and Ann. 
		Thomas and Sarah Ann had one daughter, Mattie, born 4 Apr 1859, Provo, 
		Utah. &quot;This marriage did not set well with Grandma, so she told Grandpa 
		he could have his choice but she would not live in polygamy. The mother 
		(Sarah Ann) did not like polygamy either so she left Grandpa and went to 
		Missouri, taking her little girl with her. She joined the Josephites and 
		went back to the headquarters of the Josephites in Independence, 
		Missouri (Reorganized Church).&quot; (Emma Percia Bunnell Blake) Sarah Ann 
		married second Henry Kemp, and Mattie was known throughout her life as 
		Mattie Kemp. Mattie married William D. Roberts born Aug 1856 in Iowa, 
		and they had four children all born in Independence, Mo.: Eva A., Earl 
		D., Stanley S., and Ruby C. (This is the daughter and four grandchildren 
		mentioned in Thomas' obituary.) <br />
		<br />
		Thomas Gammon died 27 Jan 1897 and is buried in the Provo City Cemetery. 
		Following is a copy of his obituary: <br />
		<br />
		Thomas Gammon, an old resident of Provo 2nd Ward, died peacefully after 
		a lingering illness, Wednesday at 20 minutes to 2 p.m. Jan. 27, 1897. 
		Deceased was born June 27, 1820 in Brampton, Devonshire, England. He was 
		raised a farmer, married Elizabeth Day 27 Oct 1840 and moved to Neath in 
		Wales shortly after. He and his wife joined the Church of Jesus Christ 
		of Latter-day Saints in 1848, and two years later commenced their 
		journey across the great ocean for Utah. It took eight weeks and four 
		days to cross the Atlantic. They reached Council Bluffs, Iowa, in May 
		1850, where they remained one year, afterwards moving to Newark, 
		Missouri, where they lived two years before crossing the plains with ox 
		teams to Utah. He arrived in Provo Sept 18, 1853. Since that time he has 
		continued to reside here, enduring many of the hardships of frontier 
		life. Mr. Gammon was an honest, industrious, and peaceable man, a good 
		neighbor, husband and father. He was the eldest of four brothers and 
		three sisters. He leaves a wife, one son, two daughters, eighteen 
		grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and a host of friends. All his 
		family live here except one daughter and four grandchildren who live in 
		Independence, Missouri. <br />
		<br />
		Elizabeth Day Gammon's obituary in the Provo newspaper states that she 
		(better known as Betsey) &quot;died on February 23, 1899 at the home of her 
		daughter, Mary Elizabeth Bunnell. She was almost 82 years old. She died 
		of general disabilities. She and her late husband, Thomas Gammon, had 
		lived in the 2nd Ward in Provo most of the time since they arrived there 
		in 1853. The funeral is Saturday February 25, 1899 at 1 PM at the Second 
		Ward Meeting House.&quot; She also was buried in the Provo City Cemetery. 
		Thomas was known as a genial, easy-going man and a hard worker. 
		Elizabeth was very neat and clean and a perfectionist in all she did. 
		She always called her husband &quot;Gammon&quot;. She had black hair and very blue 
		eyes and was tall and thin.</span><br />
