		<strong>History by Stephen Ithamer Bunnell <br />
		</strong>Written by him at Provo, Utah 14 February 1881 <br />
		<br />
		I was born in the State of Michigan, Wayne County, Feb. 1, 1834, and 
		resided there with my parents until the spring of 1842. Then moved to La 
		Harp[e], Illinois, and there witnessed many horrible things, such as, 
		mobbing, burning and threatenings to kill the saints. Among the 
		persecutions, I saw my father's property burned by the mob, who 
		threatened to kill everyone who dared lift a hand or say a word to 
		oppose their hellish deeds. But the Lord says, “Vengeance is mine and I 
		will repay.” <br />
		<br />
		In the month of June 1844, my father moved to Nauvoo, Illinois at the 
		time of the murder of the Prophet and Patriarch Joseph and Hyrum Smith. 
		We remained there until the expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo by the 
		mob. In 1846, my father moved from there to Westpoint, Iowa, and lived 
		there until the fall of 1848. <br />
		<br />
		We then moved to Indiantown, Iowa, and there with five other families 
		came near starving to death the winter of 1848. The provisions were all 
		gone about Feb 20. I, at this time, was detailed hunter for the camp as 
		I was called “Nimrod” on account of my excellent good luck with the gun. 
		About the first of March, I killed the last six prairie chickens. My 
		father gave them to the families, making one for each family. This lack 
		of food weighed heavily on my mind as I went to bed that night. I prayed 
		to God to deliver us from starvation and a comforter whispered to me, 
		.say, &quot;Fear not, for on the morrow you shall be provided for.&quot; When I 
		awoke, I did feel comforted. Imagine my joy when on arising in the 
		morning I beheld thousands of prairie chickens hovering around our log 
		cabins, and so tame that we could kill them with sticks. The Lord says 
		that it is his business to provide for his saints. <br />
		<br />
		My father remained at this place until the spring of 1852, when we 
		started across the Great American Desert and arrived in Salt Lake City, 
		Oct 5th. We came to Provo the same fall. I have helped to make canyon 
		roads, dig ditches and fight Indians. I have stood guard many a night to 
		protect our rights from the Indians. I have labored hard for one small 
		biscuit for a meal and was glad to get that. <br />
		<br />
		On Sept. 19, 1856, Miss Percia C. Grover and myself were united in the 
		bonds of matrimony by D. F. Carter. The same winter, I went east on the 
		plains for emigrants that had started across the Great Desert, a 
		distance of one-thousand miles, some on foot, carrying their provisions 
		and clothing on handcarts. Many were starved and frozen to death during 
		the journey and some became cripples for life through freezing. <br />
		<br />
		Our first born was Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Jr. born Apr 8, 1858 at 
		Provo. The second, David Conrad, born Sep. 10, 1960; Thomas William, 
		born 7, Nov. 1861; Samuel Emery, born 30 Mar, 1864; Emma Percia, born 
		June 2, 1866; Charles Albert, born 2 Aug. 1867; Leslie Lamond, born 26 
		Aug. 1869J Frederic Edwin, born June 22, 1871, Parley Pratt, born 16 
		Feb. 1874; Caroline Melissa, born 15 Aug. 1876; Arthur Wilford, born 
		July 21, 1878; and Vernee Lorenzo, born Feb. 18, 1882. <br />
		<br />
		We have seen many different scenes thus far through life but feel to 
		thank God that circumstances are as well with us as they are and feel to 
		bear testimony of the divine mission of Joseph Smith and the truth of 
		the Everlasting gospel. My prayer is that we may live in such a way as 
		to meet behind the veil and gain an everlasting salvation. <br />
		<br />
		Yours affectionately, (signed) S. I. Bunnell<br />

		<br />
		My father (David Edwin Bunnell, started for the valley of Salt Lake in 
		the spring of 1852 and I had a grand time hunting Buffalies, deer, elk 
		and antelope. There were also plenty of very large wolves. One day when 
		we were traveling along, a buffalo came from the north. A man shot him 
		and he jumped on the chain between two yokes of oxen and scared them. 
		They stampeded and ran about three miles. But they kep the road and did 
		no harm. <br />
		<br />
		Four of us were appointed hunters, for the company and we had plenty of 
		good meat until we got out of this country. One evening my brother and I 
		went ahead of the train to find water. It was late in the afternoon when 
		we saw a man in red. I said to my brother, &quot;There is a man or an Indian. 
		Maybe he can tell us where we can find water.&quot; <br />
		<br />
		So we started for him, as the sun was nearly setting and was nearly 
		down, we hurried and he came down on all fours and started for us. We 
		had picked up a stick a piece to use as walking sticks, as we were very 
		tired. As we neared the figure, it proved to be a large mountain lion. 
		We fought him about 15-25 minutes. Every time he would get hold of our 
		dog we would beat him with the clubs. My brother hit the lion on the 
		back and he fell. The dog was very badly bitten, so badly that we had to 
		haul him to Salt Lake.<br />
		<br />
		We arrived in Salt Lake City on October the 5th, where we stayed until 
		the 10th, then we went to Provo where my father and mother (Sarah Conrad 
		Bunnell) died.<br />

		<strong>Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Sr. and Percia Cornelia Graver Family
		<br />
		</strong>by Helen Bunnell Weeks, a great-granddaughter <br />
		<br />
		&quot;I was born in the State of Michigan, [Brownstown] Wayne County, Feb. I, 
		1834, and resided there with my parents David Edwin Bunnell &amp; Sarah 
		(Sally) Hellen Conrad, until the spring of 1842...In the spring of 1852, 
		we started across the Great American Desert and arrived in Salt Lake 
		City, Oct. 5th.&quot; • Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Sr., then, a young man of 
		eighteen-years of age, settled on the north bank of Provo river, West of 
		the Lakeview -Geneva road where he befriended the Indians. This 
		friendship later resulted in saving the lives of some early pioneers who 
		would otherwise have been ambushed and killed, by the Indians, had it 
		not been for &quot;Hankaboo,&quot; He later built his home about 1/2 mile north of 
		the Provo River. It was a tall two-story grey house built on the west 
		side of Lakeview road, just south of the old Sugar Beet Factory. 
		Bunnells tried to live the United Order: &quot;Stephen Ithamer Bunnell turned 
		over a lot containing part of the Old Fort Wall in Provo, a musket, some 
		and cattle and other things.&quot; Marriage: Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Sr. 
		married Percia Cornelia Grover [daughter of Thomas Grover and Caroline 
		Eliza Nickerson] on 19 September 1856, when she was fifteen years old 
		and he was twenty-two. Shortly after his marriage he volunteered to help 
		rescue members of the ill-fated Willey and Martin Handcart Companies &quot;I 
		went east on the plains for emigrants that had started across the Great 
		Desert, a distance of one-thousand miles, some on foot, carrying their 
		provisions and clothing on handcarts. Many were starved and frozen to 
		death during the journey and some became cripples for life through 
		freezing.&quot; Bunnell participated in Walker War: Grandson, L. Lamond 
		Bunnell recalls: &quot;Grandpa was called at one time to go with a group of 
		men after some of (Indian) Chief Walker's men who had killed a white man 
		on Mapleton bench. The Indians had gone up Spanish Fork Canyon and the 
		group of White men went after them. The White men hunted until they were 
		afraid to stay any longer because of darkness, then they headed down the 
		canyon. Years later, at a Black Hawk Encampment at the Old Provo Lake 
		Resort, an old Indian came up to him, calling him 'Hankaboo,' a nickname 
		the Indians had given him, and said, 'Hankaboo, you remember when you go 
		up Spanish Fork Canyon after Indian who killed white man on Mapleton 
		Bench? Grandpa said that he did. The old Indian continued: 'You ride 
		little gray mare. She get rock in foot. You no ride. You run up behind. 
		Hold tail. You remember place where bushes along side of trail?' Grandpa 
		said he remembered: 'It was a place about two-hundred yards long where 
		there was just room enough for the horses to go through between the 
		bushes.' The Indian went on: 'Injun on both side. Many Injun. Going to 
		kill white man. No can lift gun, so not kill white man. White man's God 
		heap Big!'&quot; Characteristics: Fun-loving, trickster, hot-tempered, 
		courageous: Grandpa &quot;Thame&quot; was known for his tall tales, braggadocio 
		and tricks he liked to play on others. Grandpa baits the bully in the 
		old swimming hole: A great granddaughter, Renee Frazier tells of group 
		of boys swimming in the Provo River. The town bully, wearing a buckskin 
		suit, was being particularly obnoxious this day. Grandpa kept baiting 
		him, while keeping his distance, until the rest of the boys were 
		dressed. Grandpa stood , gazing at the water, while watching the bully 
		out of the corner of his eye. He saw the bully running toward him, as 
		fast as he could. Just as he was about to give Grandpa a good shove into 
		the water. Grandpa stepped aside and the bully went, head ver heels, 
		into the water. The boys tookoff -- as-fasTas they could to avoldhis 
		wrath. The buTlyTJared not return home nTnTs&quot; wet suit so, he took it 
		off and hung it on the bushes to dry. When he tried putting it nn aoaiti

		bows rescued by another boat. Suddenly, my little three-years-old girl 
		[Percia] up through wagon cover saying: 'Lord, save my little heart!' 
		Not one perished! Now, we traveled through the cold snow and frozen

		he was born...we once again crosse Mississippi river. For the next seven 
		weeks, we continued traveling, living c doors in covered wagons. I was 
		unable to dress my little son, once, in a hi during that whole period of

		bed upon which the child and mother reclined...(P writes) &quot;My mother and 
		grandmother [Hulda Chapman Nickerson] then reti to their friendsfin the 
		East) and stayed one year (1848). My great-grandm (Abigail Chase 
		Chapman) died while they were there, aged 94 years. We cam the following 
		September with her father and mother. Grandpa [Fre Nickerson], being in 
		years could not stand the hardships of the journey. He and was buried on 
		the bank of the Platte river. [Percia said that after the tn her mother 
		had in getting to &quot;the valley&quot;...Eliza would have nothing more to dc 
		Thomas Grover. She did not believe in Polygamy. Eliza divorced Grover an 
		later sealed to her first husband, Marshall Moore Hubbard. 21 Feb 1851.] 
		Westward journey: &quot;My mother and grandmother once again started ft 
		Valley of the Salt Lake. We stopped in Fort Des Moines one winter. My m 
		took in washings to get provisions to come to the valley. Buffalo stamj 
		&quot;Grandma Percia told me that when they were crossing the plains, they 
		were up one whole day because the buffalo were stampeding. It started 
		early i morning, before they had assembled their wagons for the morning 
		start, were camped in a small grove of trees, one of the few times they 
		had a cam| like that. They first heard a noise, like thunder, and then 
		saw a cloud of They got the cattle in tight to thejamp a&quot;.d wait^O. 
		TJicr^wers afraid th« buffalo rmgnT c^e^nghhhrbu^^iTcamp.Tmrwhen ihey

		They lost a day's joi f\f *h*&gt; ofomrwtfl** ** ff^ronHcnf wet suit so, he 
		took i: off and hung it on the bushes to dry. When he tried putting it 
		on again, it had shrunk to a midget size. 2nd encounter with a bully: On 
		another occasion Grandpa, or &quot;Nimrod,&quot; as we sometimes called him, took 
		a load of wheat to Bingham, Utah. As he unloaded the seamless sacks of 
		wheat onto the platform, each sack had to be weighed. A big six-foot man 
		was being a nuisance. Each time as the scale was balanced, this man 
		moved the balance so Grandpa cold not read the weight. Finally, Grandpa 
		told him: &quot;Mister, if you do that again I shall be forced to chastise 
		you!&quot; The big guy moved the balance again. This time Grandpa was ready 
		for him and he hit him on the chin as hard as he could. He knew he had 
		broken his knuckle but he had knocked the bully off the platform and 
		onto the ground. He then jumped off the platform, right on top of the 
		still-down butly and tromped him until the bully begged to be let up. 
		Then, one of the bystanders said to the bully: &quot;Well, Mister, you have 
		been looking for a Mormon fight all day and you picked the smallest man 
		in the bunch. I hope you are satisfied now.&quot; Grandpa, the courageous 
		hunter: &quot;Grandma (Percia) said that Grandpa never failed to bring home 
		the first prize in any shooting contest he ever entered. At one time, 
		grandpa and another man trailed a mountain lion to a cave but did not 
		feel it was a good thing to go in the cave in the dark, so they made 
		another trip and brought some miner's candles and caps so they could 
		see. They drew straws to see who would go in and Grandpa got the short 
		straw. While he went into the cave, the other man stood watch on the 
		outside. Soon the man on the outside heard a shot and then a lion came 
		dashing out of the cave. The man outside shot the lion and was laughing 
		because &quot;Thame&quot; had missed a shot. But he quit laughing when Thame came 
		out dragging another lion out of the cave. There had been two lions. 
		Thame had shot the big one between the eyes by the light of the candle 
		and the other one had knocked him down getting out of the cave. &quot;Cougar 
		Story: &quot;Ithamer and his dog were walking in the grove, by Provo River, 
		just above the river bridge in Lakeview. A mountain lion dropped on him, 
		from a tree. He had no weapon with him so, Thame choked the lion, and, 
		with the help of his dog, killed the lion. Thame came walking home, with 
		the lion's paws over his shoulders, and the tail, dragging on the 
		ground. I had to tend the many deep scratches on Thame's back and arms.&quot; 
		(Karl Bunnell) Indian horses in the oats: When Grandpa first moved onto 
		the farm, the Indians under Black Hawk the 3rd. used to come and camp on 
		the farm to get their winter supply of fish. They would catch suckers 
		when they ran up the river to spawn. The suckers were easily caught then 
		and there was a good supply. Right after the second grasshopper war. 
		Grandpa had been able to plant three acres of oats and the well-growing 
		oats were in the 'boot' when the Indians came. The oats were fenced by 
		the only fence on the farm. When Black Hawk came to see about camping, 
		Grandpa told him to turn his horses in the oats but to keep the brave's 
		horses out. The next morning, when Grandpa got up, every horse was in 
		the oats. Grandpa could not take this. He grabbed his black snake whip 
		and proceeded to lash at every brave he could reach. At first, the 
		braves took it in fun as a game, but when they became mad (that whip 
		could sting). Black Hawk, who was watching from his tepee, told the 
		braves to take their horses out. That was where Grandpa got his Indian 
		name: &quot;Hankaboo,&quot; which means growl. Indian wants Percia for his squaw! 
		&quot;The Indians were often visitors at Grandpa's farm. One Hankitiwats 
		(meaning Red Whiskers) used to watch Grandma Percia milk the cows. One 
		time when she was through, he said: &quot;Me kill Hankaboo, you be my squaw!&quot; 
		She was scared half to death, but knew that you should never let an 
		Indian know you were scared, so she looked him right in the eye and 
		said: &quot;You kill Hankaboo, I kill you!&quot; He grunted, walked away and it 
		was three years before she saw him again. Caught in the rain: In his 
		later years, Grandpa &quot;Thame&quot; was staying at his sons place in Vineyard, 
		(Stephen Ithamer, Jr.) He had his wagon backed under the shed and was 
		sleeping in it. One night, it began to rain and my father, Joel and his 
		the following September with her father and mother. Grandpa [Freeman 
		Nickerson], being in years could not stand the hardships of the journey. 
		He died and was buried on the bank of the Platte river. (Percia said 
		that after the trouble her mother had in getting to 'the valley&quot;...Eliza 
		would have nothing more to do with Thomas Grover. She did not believe in 
		Polygamy. Eliza divorced Grover and was later sealed to her first 
		husband, Marshall Moore Hubbard, 21 Feb 1851.] Westward journey: &quot;My 
		mother and grandmother once again started for the Valley of the Salt 
		Lake. We stopped in Fort Des Moines one winter. My mother took in 
		washings to get provisions to come to the valley. Buffalo stampede: 
		&quot;Grandma Percia told me that when they were crossing the plains, they 
		were held up one whole day because the buffalo were stampeding. It 
		started early in the morning, before they had assembled their wagons for 
		the morning start. They were camped in a small grove of trees, one of 
		the few times they had a camp site like that. They first heard a noise, 
		like thunder, and then saw a cloud of dust. They got the cattle in 
		tight_to_the_camp a^djyajtrd. T.icy wen: afraid that the 
		TuTfaTnfflgTnoTneTlglirTnroTigTnnecSrnp, out when Uiey&quot; were near the 
		grove, they spread out and went around the camp on both sides. They lost 
		a day's journey on account of the stampede.&quot; [Grandson, L. Lamond 
		Bunnell] &quot;We arrived in Salt Lake City 27 Sept 1850, being too late to 
		put up hay, our stock all died but one. Mother taught school in a small 
		room she rented in the Old Fort in Salt Lake City. We lived in the same 
		room and got through the winter without much suffering. &quot;In the fall of 
		1852, we moved to Provo, where I have lived ever since. Grandchilden 
		remember her: Gooseberry pie. Everyone who ever tasted it wanted the 
		recipe and she was always willing to oblige. She would tell all about 
		how to make it with all the ingredients named except the sugar. When she 
		came to that part, she always inched up to the edge of her chair, then, 
		lifting her left hand up, she would say: 'and now you come to the 
		sugar...' and then she would inch up a bit farther and say: 'you put in 
		all your conscience will let you and then shut your eyes and throw in 
		three double hands full!' It always got a big chuckle. Percia's work 
		ethic: Grandma Percia abhorred laziness! She was an extremely hard 
		worker herself. She was very strong-willed and had a verj quick temper. 
		When she got mad . .. look out! I do appreciate her real desire for 
		service and her faith and determination. Grandma was very proud, loyal,

		Early History of Ellen B. Johnson (Bunnell) Written by Herself, April 3, 
		1944 <br />
		<span class="auto-style9">(Wife of one of Stephen Ithamer Bunnell's 
		son's (Leslie Lamond Bunnell)</span><br class="auto-style9" />
		<br />
		To my children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, I, Ellen B. 
		Johnson Bunnell, am seventy-three years old today. A year ago my son, 
		Merrill and his wife, Connie (Osmond) gave me this book and asked me to 
		write down memories. I should have had this book years ago, as now I 
		have forgotten many events in my life that would have been interesting 
		to read. However, I will write what I can remember of my early life. I 
		was told by my parents that I was born April 3, 1871 in Lake View, Utah 
		County, Utah, near the north bank of the Provo River in a log cabin with 
		two rooms. My father and mother lived in one room; Hans Zobell and wife 
		lived in the other room. Their first baby, named Josepha, was also born 
		in this house. My first bed was a willow basket made by my father. My 
		Uncle Andrew Sward came from Salt Lake to see his first niece. When he 
		saw the humble surroundings he was very sorry. As soon as he could find 
		a way, he sent a cradle, the best he could find in Salt Lake City. The 
		gift was very much appreciated by my mother. She took good care of it 
		and rocked her nine babies in it. I also used it for my first baby. It 
		was burned with our home later. My parents lived with Grandpa and 
		Grandma Knudsen in Provo for awhile. I first learned to talk Norwegian 
		from them. I was told I was always coaxing Uncle Herman to play his 
		violin. About this time, I became very ill. Father was away at the time 
		but was sent for, because I was not expected to live. But I did recover. 
		Then father bought a home and ten acres of land. The house was a two 
		room adobe brick in Lake View. My eight sisters and brothers were born 
		there. The first event in my young life that I remember was when I heard 
		so much talk about Uncle August and Aunt Anna Sward, who were expected 
		to arrive from Sweden. Their arrival was a real event. I was very 
		excited over meeting them, and I became especially fond of Aunt Anna. 
		She was always thinking of some way of making me happy. She would make 
		books out of plain paper and let me watch her draw pictures of flowers, 
		trees, houses, animals and people. She would write little verses about 
		the pictures she had drawn. They seemed wonderful to me. As I grew 
		older, she was a real teacher and companion. I was thirteen years old 
		when she died, leaving a beautiful black-haired baby. I’ll never forget 
		how terrible it was to think of never seeing her again. I wrote a poem 
		about her but I lost it. The next event I remember was when I was four 
		and a half years old. My sister Julia was born. I was told that she came 
		on the train that stopped at the crossing east of our home. Julia was 
		born Nov. 20, 1875. The next day, the 21st, my Aunt Hannah, who was 
		staying at our house, in the same room with my mother, also had a baby 
		girl. It all seemed strange to me, even though the train stopped at the 
		crossing that day. I liked Aunt Hannah’s baby as she had black hair and 
		lots of it. Her name was Williamana. Our baby, Julia, had to wait 
		several months before she could boast of hair. But I learned to love her 
		very much after Aunt Hannah went home. Aunt Anna took care of both of 
		her sisters and babies while they were together at our house. Aunt Anna 
		always came whenever my mother or Aunt Hannah needed help. My Aunt 
		Chesty used to visit our home often, both before and after her marriage 
		to Andrew Knudsen. She let mother use her sewing machine. I would sew on 
		it every chance I got. My mother told me that I might break the machine, 
		and besides I was wasting thread. Then I ran the machine without thread. 
		Finally mother made me understand I must leave the machine alone. It was 
		sure hard to do as I loved to sew. When I was fiver years old, I lived 
		with Grandpa and Grandma Sward and went to school at the home of Mrs. 
		Oakley who was the teacher. I was very frightened and timid at first. 
		Our good neighbor’s girl, Dena Nelson, took care of me and played with 
		me until I got to feeling at home. The next year, Mrs. Oakley came to 
		Lake View to teach. I was the only one she had met before, so she made a 
		fuss over me. I was called the “teacher’s pet” by the other pupils, and 
		finally, they got to calling me the “teacher’s cat” because she would 
		hold me on her lap while she was teaching a class. As I grew up I had a 
		feeling that I was not as good-looking or clever as the girls my age. My 
		mother was so busy with her housework and garden and a baby every two 
		years that she did not realize how I felt. Of course, I wanted to be 
		like the other girls. My Aunt Teenie Sward helped me along that line. 
		She seemed to understand. She would comb my hair and make pretty dresses 
		out of some of her old ones. Anyway, to this very day, I have not 
		learned to fix myself pretty. I guess if I live to be one hundred years 
		old, I will still be the same plain Ellen. I was very fond of jewelry. 
		The first ring I ever owned was made by Ella Clinger out of a black 
		button. I was so proud of that ring I showed it to every person I met. I 
		remember how frightened I was when I stood up before a large audience in 
		the old Tabernacle in Provo and sang with a group in Primary Conference. 
		Most of the song I still remember, and went something like this: There 
		was a little lassie and her name was Bessie Fair She was her mother’s 
		darling for she never banged her hair. She neither paint or powdered and 
		she always was so true. How many are there here today who really are so, 
		too? I think that song must have made a great impression on me, for I 
		was a girl of eighteen before I got my father’s permission to cut my 
		hair for bangs. As for powdering my face, I never used it until a few 
		years ago. And I made life miserable for my two daughters by trying to 
		keep them from the powder habit. I spent my childhood days on the farm 
		with my parents, trying to help mother in the house and father on the 
		land. I did not like outdoor work, such as doing chores and pulling 
		weeds and all the other dirty work a farmer has to do. In fact, I said I 
		would never marry a farmer. I kept my word as when I married, my husband 
		was not a farmer, but turned into one after we were married. I have 
		always hated to see people drink wine and beer. I must have got the idea 
		from mother. She could not be happy if it were around. When I married, 
		my prayer was always that my husband and children would not be 
		drunkards. I never gave liquor to my babies for colic for fear they 
		would learn to like it. When I finished the sixth grade in Lake View, I 
		went two years in Provo. George Brimhall was my teacher in the eight 
		grade, which finished my education in the class room. I was very sorry 
		as I loved school. Part of the time I was going to school in Provo, I 
		lived with Uncle Andrew and part with Aunt Chesty Knudsen. I learned to 
		love these people very much. They were jolly and happy. My mother found 
		a place for me to work in a dressmaking shop. I worked there six months 
		for the purpose of learning to make dresses. There were several other 
		girls there, and we were kept busy basting, overcasting seams, and 
		hemming, but were not shown how to cut and fit a dress. When the six 
		months were up, I was shown how to draft a plain pattern. Then I went 
		out sewing for 50 cents a day. I was very frightened when I was on my 
		own and was asked to make a dress with drapes and trimmings. But after I 
		had learned more about sewing, I received seventy-five cents a day. But 
		I was happy because I felt that I was helping mother, when I could buy 
		my own clothes and do sewing for the family. At this time, my father 
		went on a mission to Norway and mother had a hard time getting enough 
		money to send to him and also keep the family. Uncle Andrew Sward 
		visited our home very often. We children were very fond of him. We had a 
		very peculiar superstition about him. “When we heard a cricket in our 
		kitchen, we knew uncle Andrew was coming.” He always greeted us with 
		shouts of joy. He was a lover of nature and would take us on hikes and 
		picnics. He taught us to see beauty in everything outdoors. While I was 
		in Provo living with him, he sent me to all the “shows” (live theater) 
		that came to town as we had no movies then. The shows did not come every 
		night or even every week, so it was a real treat when they did come to 
		town. Uncle Andrew was an entertainer himself, as he was a ventriloquist 
		and entertained us by throwing his voice. He also played all kinds of 
		musical instruments. I lived on summer with Mr. and Mrs. Myron Newell 
		(Alice Smoot). They lived in Vineyard near Utah Lake, in the northwest 
		corner of Geneva Works. After they moved to Provo, I helped occasionally 
		when needed. They lived in Provo with Mrs. Newell’s mother, Anna K. 
		Smoot. After I learned to sew I would help with their dressmaking. They 
		appreciated very much my willingness to help when the work was too much 
		for Mrs. Newell, and I learned to like living with them. The first time 
		that Leslie Lamond Bunnell came to see me, my mother and I were in the 
		yard at home. He came up the hill to the yard and asked me to go to a 
		dance with him. He said to tell Josephine, my sister, to come along, 
		too. The next time I happened to meet him was on the street in Provo. He 
		asked me to go to Brigham Young Academy dance. I told him I would love 
		to go but the dress I had on was the only one I owned. However, I was 
		making a new one and then I would go. We went to a dance in Lake View 
		that night. When my new dress was finished, we went to the BYA to a 
		dance and several entertainments. When Leap Year came, the Lake View 
		girls planned a dance. I wrote to Leslie inviting him to be my partner 
		at the dance. I was very disappointed when he failed to call for me and 
		I had to go with my pap (as we called him, then). Several months went by 
		and I did not see Leslie. I learned that he had gone to the mountains to 
		take care of his father’s sheep. When he came home, he came to see me 
		and then I found out that he had not received my invitation in time for 
		the Leap Year dance. He was just as disappointed as I was. From then on, 
		we went steady. On the 14th of February, standing on the steps that led 
		to the kitchen door, I promised to wear a ring. He gave me the ring my 
		birthday. For two and a half year, we had a very happy courtship. Leslie 
		worked in Spanish Fork canyon getting out ties for the railroad; then he 
		got a job as a clerk in a store at M&amp;M Kilns in Spanish Fork Canyon. The 
		store was owned by S.S. Jones. The kilns mad charcoal out of wood 
		brought in by men and their horses. The men would get their supplies 
		from the store for their families and horses. It was a lot of work for 
		one man to keep track of every workman, the amount of wood brought in, 
		and the merchandise received from the store. While there, Leslie bought 
		a house and then built cupboards, tables, and other furniture for the 
		house. He also had a stove for the house. And now our Stories join 
		together. EVENTS IN THE LIVES OF LESLIE LAMOND AND ELLEN B. JOHNSON 
		BUNNELL As recalled by their two oldest children: Leslie Lamond Bunnell 
		and Leona Bunnell Nutall With some written by Ellen B.J. Bunnell, 
		herself (Before continuing with the autobiography of Ellen B. J. Bunnell 
		of her married life, a few events in the early life of Leslie Lamond 
		Bunnell, husband, will be given.) Leslie Lamond Bunnell was born the 26 
		August, 1869 in the Lake View Ward of Provo, Utah, in a log cabin just 
		north of Provo River and west of the road that still runs through Lake 
		View. According to Lamond, the oldest son of Leslie Lamond and Ellen B. 
		J. Bunnell, his father and his mother were born on the same farm in log 
		houses just a short distance from each other. The farm on which both 
		were born, belonged to Leslie’s father and mother and they probably 
		loaned a log cabin to Ellen’s parents (John Johnson and Inger Sward 
		Johnson) while the Johnsons were getting their land cleared and ready to 
		build upon. Leslie Lamond Bunnell was the seventh child and sixth son of 
		Stephen Ithamer and Percia Cornelia Grover Bunnell, who were both Utah 
		Pioneers. Leona B. Nuttall recalls a few things told to her by her 
		grandmother Percia. Grandmother said that Leslie learned to hold a cup 
		and drink from it by the age of six months; that as a child he loved to 
		feel and rub cotton; that one day, when about to years old, Leslie went 
		with her to a quilting bee and upon arriving at the house, ran ahead of 
		her into the house but rushed quickly back out and said, “Ma, there’s 
		piles and piles of cotton in there!” He had seen the cotton batts that 
		were to go into the quilts. Leslie had some advanced schooling at the 
		Brigham Young Academy (now the Brigham Young University) under Karl G. 
		Maeser and there is no question but what Dr. Maeser had a lot of 
		influence on his life. He never considered himself an alumnus because he 
		never graduated. But in later years, he was often called and urged to 
		attend the meetings and banquets of the alumni and was usually asked to 
		imitate the old Dr. Maeser’s brogue, which he did so well. On of the 
		readings he used to give was the one, “Thou, Too, Sail on, Oh Ship of 
		State.” The exposure to an education that he received at the BYA left 
		him with a strong desire for more and a determination to give his 
		children all the schooling they would take and he held firmly to this. 
		In spite of his lack of formal education in a school, he was truly well 
		educated. He could converse intelligently on any subject brought up. He 
		was very observant and learned from people he met and from nature. He 
		was unusually successful as a farmer. He made a most productive farm 
		from land that produced nothing but salt weeds. By selecting most 
		carefully the best of the seed from the best products he raised, he 
		improved practically everything he grew. Besides the “Bunnell Corn” that 
		he developed and became famous for, not only throughout the State of 
		Utah, but surrounding states, he improved the squash, tomatoes and 
		watermelon. He consistently took more first prizes and blue ribbons at 
		the County Fair and the State Fair than anyone. Leslie’s schooling was 
		cut short when he was needed on the farm and to herd sheep to try and 
		save the farm after the farm had been mortgaged to buy the sheep. 
		Leslie’s father had gone into partnership with another man and had put 
		up the money to buy a herd of sheep. The partner drove part of the sheep 
		out of the country, sold them, and skipped with the money. The money for 
		payment of the mortgage had to be raised from the sheep that were left 
		and from the products of the farm. This left no money for school 
		expenses. One day while Leslie was herding the sheep in Cedar Valley, he 
		was walking along a ledge of rocks, keeping out of the wind that was 
		rustling the grasses which prevented him from hearing the warning rattle 
		of a rattlesnake on the ledge. The snake struck him near the back of the 
		neck. Leslie shot the snake. Then seating himself on a rock, he took his 
		sharp pocketknife, cut a cross over the wound on his neck to make the 
		blood flow freely, and then called to his dog, Grover, and had the dog 
		lick the bleeding wound until he felt that all poison had been expelled. 
		And thanks to his dog, most of the poison was expelled, as Leslie was 
		sick for a day or two and then recovered. He always had a soft spot in 
		his heart for Old Grover. The family had some of Old Grover’s 
		descendants for years. He carried the X scar from this incident to his 
		grave. Leslie shot a number of rattlesnakes while herding the sheep and 
		kept them in a shoebox, that is, he kept the rattles from the 
		rattlesnakes in a shoebox for years. At one time, Leslie worked with a 
		crew in the Spanish Fork Canyon, getting out ties for the railroad. 
		Leslie told the story that one morning when they got out of bed, one of 
		the teams was missing, so the owner went to find them. In a short time, 
		the owner of the team came dashing back into the camp with a wild look 
		on his face, which was very white. The owner excitedly told that he had 
		been walking along looking for the team when all of the sudden he felt 
		he was being followed. He stopped and looked back and saw a mountain 
		lion crouched and watching him from the other side of a small gully. The 
		lion’s tail was shipping from side to side. The man quickly looked for 
		something to defend himself and saw a rock about the size of his doubled 
		fist. The man picked up the rock, threw it at the cougar with all his 
		strength, and then ran as fast as he could to the camp. The men in camp 
		got their guns and went back to the spot, finding the cougar still 
		crouched. The rock had hit him squarely between the eyes and he had 
		never moved. The cougar was a big one, nine feet from his nose to the 
		tip of his tail. Leslie and Ellen were married in the Manti Temple, 30th 
		June, 1892. They had two wedding receptions, one at Ellen’s home and one 
		at Leslie’s folks. In both places, the long tables were loaded with good 
		things to eat. (Later when Lamond talked with Mame Williamson McNamara, 
		living in Midvale, Utah, during the 1930s, and who was present at 
		Ellen’s home for that reception, she said that there was a ten gallon 
		can of new peas and potatoes along with all the other good things plus 
		60 pies, and people to eat all of it.) The Provo paper printed in part, 
		the following: “There were two wedding celebrations when the Johnson 
		family and the Stephen I. Bunnell Family each gave a party to honor 
		Leslie L. Bunnell and his lovely bride, Ellen B. Johnson. The Bunnells 
		were married June 30, 1892 in the Manti Temple. Huge banquet tables 
		loaded with chicken, roast beef, preserves, cakes, pies, and homemade 
		ice cream were centers of the celebrations. Fiddle and accordion music 
		made a pretty accompaniment for old-time dancing. The bride styled her 
		own wedding dress of white silk, with bustle and leg-omutton sleeves. A 
		wide lace flounce trimmed the train and skirt and a spray of real orange 
		blossom was worn at the throat and waist. Dainty mitts completed the 
		ensemble.” In her autobiography, Ellen, says: “We received many 
		beautiful presents. We moved to our little home at the M&amp;M kiln site in 
		Spanish Fork Canyon, taking paint and paper with us to fix up the house. 
		However, our stay was very short. The charcoal was no longer needed, so 
		everything was closed down and everyone moved away. Besides our 
		furniture, we had moved two cows to the canyon, so it was no easy thing 
		to move, especially when we had no place to go and no way to earn a 
		living. We rented one room from Uncle John and Aunt Hannah Williamson 
		who lived closed to my father and mother. Leslie worked at odd jobs and 
		we managed to live. Leslie and Will Goodridge worked for the Inland Salt 
		Lake Salt Company located near Great Salt Lake. They worked in the salt 
		ponds piling salt in great big piles. It was very cold and disagreeable 
		work. They each earned $80.” The dedication of the Salt Lake Temple took 
		place April 6, 1893. Ellen attended although she was soon to have her 
		first child. Ellen, in her autobiography had the following to say: “On 
		May 3rd, 1893, our first baby was born. We named him Leslie Lamond after 
		his father. I cannot describe how proud and happy we were and how much 
		we loved our baby. At this time, we borrowed $200 from father. We 
		started a grocery store, the first in Lake View. We kept the good in our 
		one room. Then Leslie tore down our house that we had left at M&amp;M kiln 
		site, moved the lumber to Lake View and built a home on the corner of 
		father’s land, north of Uncle John’s. He built a storefront and a living 
		room adjoining the storeroom with a shanty back of that. Later we took a 
		homemade incubator for chickens in payment for a debt owed the store. We 
		attempted to hatch chickens to sell. The incubator was kept warm by a 
		kerosene lamp. On April 5, 1894, our home was burned to the ground with 
		all our belongings.” At the time of the fire, Leslie was working at 
		Uncle Steve Bunnell’s, a mile east and a little north. Ellen was ironing 
		with Lamond witting in the basement where the incubator was. She did not 
		wait to investigate. She picked Lamond from the high chair and headed 
		for Aunt Hannah’s to get help. Leslie happened to see the smoke and 
		fire. He jumped on a colt that had never been ridden and dashed down to 
		the store. On arriving, he ran into the house searching for Ellen and 
		the baby. As he stepped foot out he was minus the shoe. So there he was: 
		he had the clothes on his back and one shoe, was $200 in debt, the store 
		and its contents gone and wife and child to take care of. The Grover 
		Cleveland depression was about to get underway. What a way for young 
		couple to start anew. Incidentally, the box of rattles from the 
		rattlesnakes he had shot and treasured, was burned in this fire, too. 
		After the fire, Leslie and Ellen moved to Leslie’s father’s farm, north 
		of Provo river (a few homes in between the farm and the river). The farm 
		had been the home of Leslie’s brother, Stephen. This farm had every kind 
		of fruit that would grow in Utah. There was also room for a garden. 
		Leslie chopped wood, killed ducks and sold them, and worked at every and 
		any kind of work he could find. In September, Leslie obtained work at 
		the Lehi Sugar Company, in Lehi. He lived in a covered wagon and cooked 
		his meals on a camp fire in order to save money. Ellen made a trip to 
		Lehi once a week with bread and other food. The next spring, 1895, they 
		rented land at Caryhurst, close to the mouth of Provo Canyon. They found 
		the land to be very poor. They had to sell a cow to live. Leaving the 
		farm at Carryhurst, Leslie and Ellen rented the Old Factory Farm owned 
		by Grandma Percia Bunnell. (Later Grandman Percia sold this property to 
		Jessie Knight of Provo, who sold it to the Utah Idaho Sugar Company as a 
		site for “cutting plant” or beet slicer. After the beets were cut in 
		this plant, the juice was squeezed out, and then the juice was pumped 
		through a pipeline to Lehi, Utah, a distance of about twelve miles, 
		where it was made into sugar. Leslie worked very hard on the farm and 
		when farm work wasn’t pressing, he worked at other jobs. One winter, he 
		worked for the Madsens fishing under the ice on Utah Lake. He worked ten 
		hours a day for fifty cents a day. When farm work needed to be done, he 
		would have the milking done and the horse, Old Jose, hitched to the one 
		row cultivator, waiting for it to get light enough so he could see the 
		rows in the field. Leslie was the first one in Lake View and probably 
		the first in Utah County to build a beet rack. The beets had previously 
		been hauled in the old double wagon box bed and thirty-five hundred 
		pounds was a big load. Leslie’s new rack hauled eight thousand pounds, 
		or four ton. On the 15th of September, 1897, Leslie and Ellen welcomed a 
		baby girl, whom they named, Leona. About a year before Leona was born, 
		Lamond remembers an incident that made a lasting impression on him and 
		gave him a healthy respect for water. Leslie, Ellen, and Ellen’s sister 
		and husband Aunt Josephine and Uncle Bill Goodridge went on an outing to 
		the Provo River taking Lamond along. The women planned to swim and the 
		men to fish for bass. Ellen and Aunt Josephine wore Mother Hubbard 
		dresses, while Lamond was allowed to run around in his birthday suit. He 
		protested but his mother said that no one would see him but those 
		present and he could play at the edge of the water. As soon as the men 
		moved down stream to fish, Ellen, telling Lamond to stay right at the 
		edge of the water, waded into the stream. As the water deepened, she 
		lost her footing and slid under the water into the darkness where the 
		shadow of the bank covered the water and they couldn’t see her. Aunt 
		Josephine began to yell and the men came running back. They jumped into 
		the water, located her, and pulled her out. Ellen put up such a 
		desperate fight that she almost drowned the two men. The incident was a 
		topic of conversation for a long time. Lamond also recalls that when 
		Leona was old enough to walk around with him, they used to play games. 
		As he had a bow and arrow, the game was usually “hunting.” This day, 
		Lamond was mad at the establishment. Leona had a brand new straw hat! He 
		was a boy, older than she, and still had to wear a sunbonnet tied tight 
		to his head with long strings under his chin to keep his big ears 
		against his head to train his ears not to stick out, so far the method 
		hadn’t helped a bit. To him, his ears just became bigger (so he could 
		hear better what was being said around him). He felt he was being 
		discriminated against and resented the fact, so he needed something to 
		shoot at. The two children could not find anything worth shooting at 
		until they spotted the bee hives off to one side of the house. At last 
		here was something captive even if they did fly in and out. Lamond sat 
		down in front of the hive and shot a time or two at the bees as they 
		moved in and out but with no luck. Then he decided to shoot into the 
		hive itself. It took quite a few shots before he finally put an arrow 
		right in the door of the hive. The buzzing noise stopped and then every 
		available bee was to dispatch the intruder. Lamond dropped the bow and 
		started to run but there was no getting away from the angry swarm. He 
		felt like the soldiers in the “Charge of the Light Brigade” …bees to the 
		left, bees to the right, etc. He finally jumped in the rain barrel (a 
		barrel placed at the corner of the house, under the eves to catch the 
		rain from the roof.) When he came up for air, the bees were gone. He 
		climbed out of the barrel but had to yell for his mother to come get 
		him. He could not see! Leona? She had dropped her hat but the bees did 
		not touch her. However the hat stayed where she dropped it until after 
		dark before anyone would go after it. Lamond had to be led around by his 
		mother for a day or two. A little later in the summer there was another 
		episode with the bees. Leslie had four calves, each with a rope around 
		its neck and the other end of the rope tied to a stake. The stake could 
		be changed each day by driving it into the ground where the grass was 
		not eaten off. One day one of the calves pulled its stake out of the 
		ground, then proceeded to walk over to the other calves, catching its 
		steak in the other ropes, and soon all stakes had been pulled out of the 
		ground and a hopeless entanglement ensued. The calves tried to wander, 
		but like people, each wanted to go its own way and each way was a 
		different direction. The calves finally wandered into the area of the 
		beehives, which were placed between two trees. The calves wanted to go 
		thru by the hives but again they could not agree, and some tried to go 
		on one side of the hives, while others tried to go on the other side and 
		soon four or five hives were upset. When Ellen heard the calves bawling, 
		she went to see what was wrong. When she saw the situation, she ran back 
		to the house, grabbed Lamond’s sunbonnet, put it on, grabbed a butcher 
		knife and ran back outside to cut the ropes to free the calves from the 
		bees. But the bees had a different idea. The bees knew they had been 
		invaded and were in a fighting mood and were ready to attack anything 
		that moved. They took after Ellen and she headed back fro the house, 
		with the bees in hot pursuit, while she tried to hold them away by 
		slashing at them with the butcher knife. Lamond doesn’t remember how 
		many bees his mother sliced, but he does remember that the cut a slash 
		in his sunbonnet right by the ear. The bees finally ran out of stingers, 
		but not before the ears of the calved had been stung so much that they 
		fell off. All the calves died. Lamond will never forget the sight of his 
		mother running toward the house, in slow motion, swinging that butcher 
		knife at the bees. It was at this same farm that Lamond and his mother 
		had a good laugh at Leslie’s big black Langshan rooster. This rooster 
		was head of the flock that included brown leghorns, barred rocks, and 
		black leghorns. Leslie had a coop for the chickens at night but during 
		the day they wandered all over the barnyard. It was a job to try to find 
		all the nests when it came time to gather the eggs. Every once in a 
		while, some old hen would steal a nest, and eventually come forth 
		cluck-clucking at a bunch of downy chicks. Back to the rooster… In those 
		days, the screen doors were often covered with mosquito netting as the 
		regular wire screen was very expensive. Ellen had the kitchen door and 
		most of the windows covered with the netting. One day, the black rooster 
		came to the kitchen and walked right through the netting and into the 
		kitchen. Ellen and Lamond tried to shoo him out but the rooster went 
		into the pantry and jumped on the table by the window and then out of 
		the window. But as he stooped to jump, he sat on a sheet of Tanglefoot 
		Fly Paper and it was stuck to his tail. When he landed on the ground, 
		that “thing” was right behind him, and how he did run. Ellen and Lamond 
		tried to catch him, between shouts of laughter, but the rooster evaded 
		them and finally ran under the granary to escape. It was dark under the 
		granary and he could not see the paper so that when he came out, it was 
		still there behind him. Away he went again. This time Ellen caught him 
		and took the paper off and part of the tail that came with it. The old 
		rooster did not look quite natural for a time but he finally grew more 
		tail feathers. He never tried to come into the house again. It was about 
		this time that they had the traditional “goose” for the Fourth of July 
		instead of Christmas. In fact it was the only time they had goose for 
		the Fourth. In anticipation of the Fourth, Leslie used to stock up on 
		fireworks, then would wake up the family early on the morning of the 
		Fourth with fireworks. This particular Fourth was the first year the 
		“Salute” fireworks came out. This type costs a little more but they were 
		big and loud. They cost three for a dime. This Fourth morning, Leslie 
		had been shooting firecrackers and the commotion attracted the attention 
		of an old gander. Just as Leslie lighted a “Salute” the old gander 
		grabbed it, thinking it might be good to eat, turned it around in his 
		bill so he could swallow it, when the Salute went off? So they had goose 
		for dinner. It tasted as good as it did at Christmas. Lamond also 
		remembers that his father had hired a Frenchman who came along on the 
		“tramp” looking for work. Leslie hired the Frenchman to help him out. It 
		was the Frenchman’s job to get the cow up to the barn for milking. He 
		wanted to ride the horse to go to the pasture but he could not get on 
		the horse unless he was up on something, so he climbed on at the barn 
		and then rode to pasture. He was unable to maneuver Old Jose close 
		enough to the gate to unlock it, and in over reaching, Frenchy fell off. 
		Jose came back to the barn without him. Frenchy was so angry that he 
		walked back to the barn without bringing the cow, climbed on Old Jose 
		and off he went again. This time he anticipated Jose’s moves, and when 
		she shied away from the gate, he hung on. Then Jose bolted and ran back 
		the barn. This time she went in the barn with Frenchy on her back…at 
		least, she started in with him on her back but when she got in, Frenchy 
		wasn’t there. There was not that much room as the door was too low, and 
		Frenchy got the brushoff. Frenchy was furious. Lamond supposes that if 
		he had understood French, he would have had an education in what not to 
		say in refined company. Frenchy used to hold Leona on his lap and teach 
		her French words but when he found out that Lamond was learning them 
		faster than she was, he quit helping her. It was at this farm that 
		Lamond learned that his Dad meant what he said. Leslie to Lamond that 
		the calves should be brought from the pasture to the corral before dark 
		each day…this was Lamond’s assigned task. The calves were in a small 
		pasture that was in the bend of the creek that ran on the south side of 
		the farm. It was almost entirely enclosed with cottonwood tress and 
		willows and Lamond thought the place was “spooky.” One day Lamond had 
		been to his friend, Sammie’s house, to play and was having such a good 
		time that it was dark before he left for home. On the way, he was 
		running along the pathway just off the road where wild currant bushes 
		were hanging over the road and he had to duck to get under them, when 
		right in the middle of the trail something suddenly let out a howl and 
		jumped and ran. It was a dog that had been asleep in the sand and had 
		been startled by Lamond. He didn’t know which one was the most scared. 
		When he arrived home, he was to learn what “scared” was. Leslie asked if 
		he had the calves up and he had to say, “No!” Leslie said, “Better get 
		them!” Lamond headed down to the dark pasture. The Provo river was 
		making a lot of noise and Lamond’s hears was thumping, and the startled 
		hootowls didn’t help either. He found the calved were scattered all over 
		the pasture. After that frightening experience, Lamond had the calves in 
		the corral before dark. Leslie always had time to help his children. 
		Leslie had a good baritone voice and his children remember his rendition 
		of “Sweet Marie” and “Darling Nellie Gray.” One morning before Leslie 
		left for the field, Lamond asked him to sing, “Poor Uncle Ned.” Leslie 
		sang the verse. Almond sat on the woodpile going over the verse until 
		Leslie came for lunch. At noon, Leslie sang the chorus. Since then, 
		Lamond has never had any trouble learning a song. When Lamond was having 
		trouble counting correctly…he used to miss the 6 or 7, Leslie cut up 10 
		pieces of meat and told Lamond that he could eat the meat when he could 
		count it. It didn’t take long. Wonder why it is that we can learn fast 
		when we are faced with necessity? Leslie always had cows and that 
		naturally led him into the next phase of his life. When he took over the 
		Old Factory Farm from Grandma Percia Bunnell, she left him a butter 
		route in Provo. Grandma had made the butter the old-fashioned way of 
		putting the milk in pans, setting the pans on a brick shelf in a 
		semi-basement that had cold artesian water piped into it. The cold 
		running water kept the room cool. It was a beautiful sight to see the 
		pans of milk with all the golden cream on the top. After the cream had 
		come to the tops, it was skimmed off and put to sour. When the cream 
		reached the right stage, it was churned in an old churn with a handle on 
		a dasher that went up and down. After the butter was churned and molded 
		into squares (there was a form for this, or a mold) and wrapped with 
		squares of paper, Grandma Percia would take it to Provo and sell it from 
		house to house. She always had many good customers among what Grandma 
		called the best people in Provo. Leslie improved the way of handling the 
		cream by buying a separator and a new churn. The farmers of the area had 
		been selling the milk produced to the Union Dairy owned by Andrew 
		Holdaway and George Smoot and situated just west of where the old 
		Vineyard church used to be. The diary was right by the Denver and Rio 
		Grande Railroad track. The milk, after it was cooled, was sent by train 
		to the mining community of Eureka where it was sold retail to the then 
		“booming” area. All of a sudden, the Union Dairy went out of business, 
		leaving the farmers in a bind as they had no place to sell the milk. The 
		farmers depended on the milk as their only cash crop except for the 
		Sugar Company. Grandpa John Johnson (Elle’s father) being the Bishop, 
		tried to help the people in his ward. He suggested to Leslie that Leslie 
		should buy the milk from the farmers, thus getting into a business of 
		his own besides helping out the whole community. Leslie decided to try 
		it. A third child was soon to join the family and he needed to expand. 
		Leslie bought a large churn, a boiler, and an engine, and when he heard 
		about a larger separator for sale in American Fork, he took Lamond with 
		him to buy it. The business grew. Leslie built a small building yet 
		large enough to handle the milk equipment and everyone helped with the 
		project. A second son, but third child, was born 19th of September, 
		1899. He was named Merrill John. Grandma Percia decided to sell the farm 
		to Jesse Knight and he in turn sold it to the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company 
		for a beet slicing plant. Grandpa Johnson again came to Leslie’s aid 
		with another suggestion. As Bishop, Grandpa Johnson had been asked by a 
		ward member, Charlotte Peterson, a Danish sister whose husband had died 
		some years before, to take over her farm, let her live there until she 
		died, and then the place would belong to him. Grandpa didn’t want to do 
		this himself, and knowing that Leslie had to leave the Old Factory Farm, 
		he talked to Leslie and one of his other sons-in-law, Uncle Bill 
		Goodridge and suggested that they share the property and take the 
		contact from him. They accepted. Now Leslie had a farm but no house to 
		live in. However, the Sugar Factory was several years being built, so we 
		did not have to move immediately. There was a large barn on the Old 
		Factory Farm. The peacocks used to roost on the top of it. One night the 
		peacocks were making a big racket. Leslie got up to investigate. He 
		found a big owl was after them. He got the shot-gun and shot the owl in 
		the dark. There was also a board fence on the east side of the property 
		and the county road was east of the fence. The old peacock used to preen 
		on top of that fence when people would drive along the road. He loved to 
		strut and do his stuff. One day Andrew Fillerup from Vineyard was going 
		to Provo on a hot summer day. He had a long-tailed buggy without a top. 
		He was snoozing as the horse was jogging along. The peacock was on the 
		fence ready to show-off. As the buggy approached, the peacock seemed to 
		realize that the buggy was not going to stop and he let out a scream 
		that would wake the dead. The horse jumped, the buggy lurched, popping 
		the old man’s head back. It looked as if a runaway was in the making for 
		a second, but the horse was too tired and the old man too sleepy. The 
		buggy passed on and the peacock put on his show without an audience that 
		time. While the railroad tracks were being built to service the sugar 
		factory, Lamond had his only solo ride on a railroad car. There was a 
		car load of rails sitting right near the barn on the track. Lamond had 
		watched the train crews release the brakes on the cars and the movements 
		they went thru in moving cars. There was a down grad as the track went 
		past the factory. Lamond climbed up on the car loaded with the rails, 
		was able to release the brake. The car started to move slowly and then 
		gained speed. Lamond tried to put the brake back on but to no avail. The 
		car was going faster all the time. There was a big pile of dirt at the 
		end of the track. Lamond remembers Art Harding, who worked for Uncle 
		Bill Goodridge, running toward the car and yelling but he could not tell 
		what Art said. Anyway, Lamond was busy getting off the car. He just 
		dropped off seconds before the car hit the dirt. That was the only time 
		he ever saw rails fly through the air like toothpicks. He had been good 
		friends with the railroad crew up to this time but stayed out of sight 
		the rest of the time he lived there. Leslie always got along well with 
		his neighbors and was always willing to help when he could. Across the 
		road from the farm lived Mads Jorgensen, who was a polygamist with two 
		wives and two homes. In the days of the underground, the United States 
		Revenue Officers had tried their best to get hold Mads Jorgenson on a 
		charge of unlawful cohabitation but they were never successful. One time 
		Grandpa Steven I. Bunnell found Charlie Redfield, who was the leader of 
		the Revenue Officers, in the top of the barn moving the hay around to 
		see if Mr. Jorgenson was hiding under it. Grand ran Mr. Redfield out at 
		the point of a pitchfork and threatened to kill him if he ever caught 
		him there again. Lamond recalls that his father, Leslie, told him that 
		there were six men on horses riding through the Jorgenson oat filed on 
		day, when all of a sudden there was some shooting and the Revenuers got 
		out in a hurry. Lamond asked who was doing the shooting and Leslie said 
		he thought the shots sounded as if they came from Uncle Steve’s place at 
		the first road east and north of the old farm. Later when Lamond was 
		picking peaches at Uncle Steve Bunnell’s place, he asked Uncle Steve if 
		he remembered the incident and Steve did. Lamond asked if he had done 
		the shooting. Steve said, “No, where did you get that idea?” Lamond told 
		him what Leslie had said. Steve laughed and said, “That was your Dad. He 
		was shooting my Sharps Needle gun from my hayloft, trying to see how 
		close he could come to the revenuers without knocking their hats off.” 
		Lamond guesses that the creamery building at the Old (Sugar) Factory 
		Farm was built sometime during the year of 1899, because he remembers 
		that Leslie worked all one day getting a whistle installed so the New 
		Century (1900) could be properly welcomed. At the stroke of twelve, he 
		pulled the whistle cord down and tied it tight and began to shovel coal 
		into the boiler to keep the whistle going. After half an hour, the 
		Jorgenson twins, Zina Jorgenson (Scott) and Vira Jorgenson came over and 
		pretested the noise for so long a time. Leslie’s answer was to shovel 
		more coal. He kept that whistle going for the first hour of the New 
		Century so that it was properly welcomed into Lake View with a blast. 
		Leslie operated the older creamery at the factory farm until he had a 
		new one built at the Charlotte Peterson place. When the Sugar Company 
		began construction of the factory, Leslie moved his family to his 
		mother’s home, Grandma Percia Bunnell. A third son but fourth child was 
		born the 13th of October 1901. He was named LeRoy. Later when the 
		creamery was finished on the new site, provision was made for one large 
		room in which the family could live while the construction of a house 
		was in progress. While the creamery was being built, Lamond recalls that 
		he used to stand on the scaffold and catch the bricks as the were thrown 
		up from the ground. He also had to get up early and help milk the cows, 
		then Leslie would throw the harnesses on the team and Lamond would stand 
		in the manger and put the collars on upside down and then turn them 
		around on the horse’s neck as he could not reach high enough to fasten 
		them on top. Then he would pull the harness ahead and fasten the hames 
		and the belly strap. Then the team would be ready for Ed Carter to hitch 
		to the wagon for the run to pick up the milk form the farmers. People 
		are funny! Many are unappreciative and would sell their souls for more 
		money. Lamond learned early that all people were not as honest as his 
		father. Lamond’s job in the creamery was to empty the milk cans (can 
		full of milk as they came from the farmers) into the warming tank where 
		the milk was heated for separating. On two occasions, as he emptied the 
		cans of milk, several polliwogs came out of the cans with the milk. He 
		realized that these dishonest farmers, when they had put the cans out 
		beside the road for the driver (Mr. Carter) to pick up, had taken the 
		lids off the cans dipped the lids into the slough by the side of the 
		road and filled the cans to increase the volume. When Lamond told his 
		father, Leslie went to Salt Lake and bought a Babcock tester. There was 
		no more paying a straight price of so much per 100 pounds, but from then 
		on, the farmers were paid only for butter fat content. This stopped 
		watering down the milk. The new home site was soon named “Variwood” 
		because of the many varieties of trees that Leslie planted as a grove 
		just south of the creamery building. He first planted the seeds in one 
		corner of the plot and then used the plants, not only for the grove, but 
		for around the new home site and other areas. Leslie also planted, on 
		the south side of the grove, raspberries, currant bushes and gooseberry 
		bushes from which most of the fruit for the family was obtained until 
		the trees in the grove became to large and shaded the fruit so much that 
		it didn’t flourish. Leslie then planted orchard grass among the trees so 
		that it became a good area for a picnic. Many of the organizations of 
		the ward enjoyed picnics and parties besides the family gatherings and 
		reunions (that still take place there.) While the family was still 
		living at the creamery, Leslie got the smallpox and lived at Uncle Peter 
		Madsen’s home for about three weeks so that he wouldn’t have to close 
		the creamery. The Peter Madsen family had already had the smallpox. 
		Ellen and the children were all vaccinated so Leslie was the only one to 
		have the disease. Ed Carter ran the creamery while Leslie was 
		indisposed. At this time, Leslie and Uncle Samuel E. Bunnell bought one 
		hundred and sixty acres of land that belonged to the Dell Roberts farm. 
		They paid one thousand dollars for the piece that was located west of 
		the new farm site. Leslie took the south half of the land and Uncle Sam 
		took the north half. Leslie’s half was 80 acres. Leslie’s part had a lot 
		of alkali. When he first got it, one could fill a beet rack full of 
		plain old alkali or saleratus with a scoop shovel. Leslie filed a claim 
		on a stream of water that ran through the place where the new home was 
		to be built. This stream of water had run to waste for years. The stream 
		started with the run off from some swampland at the edge of the bench. 
		Leslie figured he could wash the alkali out of the ground by running 
		water on it through the winter. He did this, changing the water several 
		times. The ground looked good in the spring, so it was plowed and 
		planted. The oats came up and looked good until the time it was ready to 
		go into the boot and then the oats withered, turned yellow and died. The 
		ground was washed another winter, planted in the spring, but the crop 
		didn’t mature. Then Leslie decided he would have to drain the ground and 
		wash it too. He thought that this would was the alkali out of the 
		ground. And that finally happened but it was then years before he got 
		enough off the crops in the fall to pay for the seed planted in the 
		spring. A lot of time was spent by the boys and by Leslie digging 
		ditches through the hard pan (which was so hard that when hit with a 
		pick, the sparks would fly) but after the hard pan had lain on top of 
		the ground for a year or two, it disintegrated. A lot of tile was buried 
		end to end in ditches, covered over with soil, to drain off the alkali 
		in the excess water. This system finally paid off after many years of 
		hard work. While still living in the creamery, another son was born on 
		the 9th of November 1903, and named Irwin Grant. Work had been 
		progressing on a new two-story home located just south of the grove of 
		trees with a huge lawn in front that would give plenty of play room for 
		the family of boys. The house was finished in 1904. It had three 
		bedrooms upstairs with a huge walk-in clothes closet. The ground floor 
		had a bedroom, living room, kitchen, pantry and a large utility and 
		storage room. How good it must have seemed to Ellen to have some room to 
		move around in. It was here that the family began having real home life. 
		The basement under the house had room for the cream separator for the 
		family, shelves for bottled fruit, and winter vegetables and more 
		storage. It was in the cellar that many a big freezer of ice cream was 
		made. Leslie had his own recipe that was so good that his ice cream was 
		in demand for many of the ward picnics and celebrations. Lamond and 
		Leona remember that after they moved into the new house that they had to 
		run home from school, eat lunch at noon, and then wrap 150 pounds of 
		butter, and get back to school in one hour. The family worked hard and 
		played hard. Leslie really believed that “All work and no play makes 
		Jack a dull boy.” Accordingly, he would say, “Well boys, if we get a 
		certain job done in time, we will go to the lake for a swim.” Or, “If we 
		get through with the beets or hay, we will go fishing for a day.” We 
		worked so that we were always through and Leslie saw to it that the boys 
		were given what he had promised. When the group went fishing, Uncle 
		Steve Bunnell liked to go along. He and “Teddy” (Irwin) would have a 
		ball. Many family traditions were established that were enjoyed by all. 
		During the long winter evenings and when driven indoors by rain or snow, 
		Leslie would pop corn in his home-made popper that was three times 
		larger than anything that could be bought. Two poppers full would fill a 
		dishpan with large snowy, tender kernels. The corn cobs would make the 
		stove red-hot so the popping was fun for the children to watch. 
		Sometimes Leslie would butter the corn. At other times he experimented 
		with molasses, sugar, and flavorings until he had a number of original 
		recipes that were much in demand. Sometimes he left the popcorn plain, 
		but it was always delicious. A second daughter was added to the family 
		with the birth of “Vinna” on the 5th of November 1905. She was followed 
		by a son Karl Grover, born the 18th of April 1908; Jesse Dean, born 23rd 
		of February 1910, and by Elvin Wayne, born 28th February 1912. Leona 
		recalls many of the wonderful family things that happened when she was 
		young. She says: “I remember that Dad was great on celebrating important 
		days. I remember the firecrackers on the Fourth of July and the 
		Twenty-Fourth of July, a holiday celebrated by Utahns commemorating the 
		arrival of the Pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley. I crawled as far as 
		possible under the bed clothes to get away from the noise of the 
		firecrackers. I remember the first Fourth of July in the new house, when 
		I awoke in the morning with flags all around my bed and Dad and the 
		older boys sitting around waiting to see how I would react. I remember 
		trips to the Lake Resort on holidays and going in the boat with Dad, 
		Mother, Uncle Sam and Aunt Julia. On one of these boat rides, probably 
		the first one they had taken me on, Dad rocked the boat in order to get 
		the women frightened and only succeeded in frightening me until it took 
		a great deal of his time and patience later to get back into a boat. But 
		Dad persevered until the boat ride became the pleasure I enjoyed more 
		than anything we did. Dad spent many hours taking us fishing, boating, 
		trips to the lake to swim, camping trips into the mountains, etc. I also 
		remember the merry-go-round he built with the wagon wheel and planks, 
		and the many swings he put up that eventually were nearly always pulled 
		down because someone got hurt on them. Seems as if LeRoy got most of 
		those cuts and bruises. I remember Dad’s generosity when he was the 
		instigator, but his dislike of being asked for things. I have wondered 
		if this were because he was a little embarrassed that he hadn’t thought 
		of it himself. I remember the Christmases that he loaded a bob sleigh 
		with meat, vegetables, fruit, and anything he could share, and driving 
		from one end of the ward to the other, giving something to those he felt 
		might need it to make their Christmas a little happier. He did many 
		things in the ward besides his teaching positions. For years he was 
		always the ward Santa Claus at the Christmas parties; he was the main 
		builder of floats for parades the ward participated in; also his 
		generosity to the church and the ward members both physically and 
		financially. My husband, James A. Nuttall, told me this story 
		recently…one that I had forgotten or never knew since I wouldn’t have 
		been in the men’s meetings. When the Ward planned to put lights other 
		than coal oil lamps in the church house, Lewis Olsen suggested that they 
		try to raise the money through donations by the ward members. Dad 
		immediately pledged himself for most of the cost of the new lights; 
		there were many others there who could have afforded it much easier than 
		he could. I remember Dad always taking us to church when Mother was 
		unable to do so. Of his taking us on Easter trips on Saturday so we 
		could go to Church on Sunday and still have our trip. I can’t say that 
		we children appreciated this when most of our crowd went on Sunday but 
		this showed Dad’s sincerity in his belief. I remember how he always paid 
		an honest tithing although many times he would have to borrow the money 
		to do so, as he hadn’t received payment yet for the crops raised on the 
		farm. He always paid his tithing in cash although at that time much of 
		the tithing was paid in produce. He was always proud of the fact that 
		his word was as good as his bond, to the Lord as well as to people. I 
		remember Dad’s activities in Religion Class, as Sunday School and 
		Priesthood class leader, ward dramatics, when at time the cast would be 
		taken to perform as far away as Alpine, Utah, how he and Lamond used to 
		go together to rehearsals and singing engagements of Johnson’s Male 
		Chorus. How proud and handsome they both looked. I remember that before 
		doctors were easy and quick to get hold of, that many times Dad was the 
		first one called by friends and neighbors as he had an uncanny way of 
		knowing what to do. He was a tower of strength, and a man of great faith 
		although this was something he was shy about showing. I remember the 
		prayers and nursing when LeRoy was so ill with pneumonia at four years 
		of age; the whole family kneeling around LeRoy’s bed each morning for 
		our family prayer; of Dad offering a special prayer for him one morning 
		and from that time on, he started to improve; that when the new baby, 
		Jesse Dean was so ill, that Dad seemed to hold Jesse Dean here after the 
		Doctor had given up; and that when Dad realized that the Lord probably 
		wanted him, and to hold the baby here against the Will of the Lord would 
		be a mistake, he dedicated Jesse to the Lord; and how Jessie Dean was 
		immediately released from his suffering; how Dad molded Irwin’s little 
		fingers back to its normal shape after the finger had been shut in a 
		door when Irwin was a little toddler. The doctor said he couldn’t have 
		done better and to have waited for him to drive by horse and buggy from 
		Provo, would have risked the loss of or a deformed finger. Of Dad’s 
		quick action the time Karl, as a toddler, accidently sat down in a 
		bucket of scalding hot milk. Dad quickly cut off Karl’s clothes and 
		smeared the burned area with the only thing available…Vaseline…and how 
		Dad took care of him afterwards. Karl has only a few tiny scars today. I 
		remember the pets around the farm; the cages with wheels in them for the 
		wild animals to run on; how the cage was usually occupied by chipmunks, 
		kangaroo rats, weasels, squirrels, etc.; and the de-scented skunks; and 
		the horrified looks on the faces of unsuspecting people who were 
		confronted by the skunks, as the people approached the house.” Leslie 
		was also active in the Utah Farm Bureau organization and the Wild Life 
		Federation. He was on the Boards and Chairman of the Boards of 
		Agricultural exhibits for years and always worked endless hours, when 
		given those responsibilities. Through these activities he became well 
		acquainted with the leaders of counties, cities, and the State. His home 
		was open at anytime to his acquaintances and friends, much to the 
		chagrin of Ellen, at times, as she never knew who he might bring home 
		for a meal without advanced notice. As she did not consider herself a 
		good cook, she worried about the plain food she would serve these 
		people. But they always ate heartily and seemed to enjoy plain food as 
		much as the family did. Leona maintains to this day that no one could 
		roast meat as her mother did, so Ellen’s poor opinion of her cooking was 
		never justified in the sight of family and friends. Ellen’s sweetsoup, a 
		Danish dish, was famous and much in demand. Leona records some of her 
		recollections of her mother (Ellen). Leona writes: “In spite of the 
		number of children Mother had to take care of, she always did her share 
		for the church. One of my earliest recollections is of a party held for 
		her and a picture given to her in appreciations of her services, when we 
		lived in the one room of the creamery, and Mother had been released from 
		being President of the YLMIA (Young Ladies Mutual Improvement 
		Association) to become President of the Relief Society. When her family 
		demands became too great, she was released from this position, but she 
		was never without a teaching position in the ward or the stake. As all 
		of us Children know, mother loved to write poetry and seemed to be able 
		to do so at will. One poem that never fails to bring tears to my eyes 
		and mother’s face to my vision is, “When the Tulips Bloom Again.” She 
		and Dad both had a love for poetry and music. I remember Mother saying 
		that she just wrote verse but Dad really wrote poems but he would never 
		keep them, so I never read any of his. Mother also had a very good alto 
		voice and the ability to harmonize. I remember them singing many times 
		together. After they brought the organ, Mother used to cord on it and 
		accompany the two of them, or sometimes sing by herself. They used to 
		sing together “After the Ball.” I remember Dad singing “The Dark-Eyed 
		Sailor” and “Old Uncle Ned,” while Mother sang “Two Little Girls in 
		Blue” and “Two Little Playmates.” Of course, there were many others. In 
		her later years when she had time to do other things than just those 
		demanded of a conscientious mother, she taught herself to crochet and 
		embroider. These days when so many people take up “painting” as a hobby, 
		I think of how much both mother and Dad would have enjoyed doing that. 
		Mother loved everything beautiful and especially enjoyed the tulips that 
		were planted from the house to the street. Dirt in any form was 
		distasteful and distressing to her sensitive nature. An uncouth or lewd 
		remark or story or profanity seemed to almost make her ill. Dad and 
		Mother had almost completely different natures in many ways. Dad was 
		quicker than greased lightning, while Mother was slow and deliberate. 
		Dad’s temper was set off easier than a mouse trap while Mother was 
		seldom riled. Dad was inclined to be domineering, while Mother even 
		disliked having to tell her children what to do. Dad loved fishing and 
		hunting and spending hours searching for Indian arrowheads and 
		artifacts, while Mother, even though she loved nature, preferred to take 
		it a little less actively. Mother, over the years changed some and 
		softened many of Dad’s attitudes and knowing the patience this required, 
		I marvel at the accomplishment. Mother seemed to have her fingers on the 
		pulse of every situation and was able to advise with the wisdom of 
		Solomon. Her constant good humor, her constant help, and her ability to 
		cheer one up when the blues took over was appreciated by the family. She 
		was in truth a real peacemaker. In spite of the differences between the 
		two, their ideals and ambitions for their children were the same. They 
		worked and saved together to educate their children and send four of 
		their sons on missions. Their love for each other was great.” When the 
		family first moved to the new site (Peterson Place), some of the ground 
		was not so good. The piece of ground directly across the road from the 
		church was so swampy that one could not walk across it. Leslie began 
		turning waste water onto this piece and it was surprising how much sand 
		the waste water brought in. After a few years, the dirt filled in, and 
		it has been farmed ever since. The next piece west was called The Swamp 
		in the beginning and for years afterwards. The ducks would come in there 
		by the thousands to feed in the winter. Uncle Don Williams once stood in 
		the west door of the cow barn and with the old 32/40 Winchester, fired 
		one shot and killed two ducks, there were that many there. But this 
		gradually filled in and built soil, as did the Old Otter Hole at the 
		lower northwest corner of the lower field, and the Mud Lake just below. 
		Of course, the water did double duty, it worked at the home place first 
		and the lower field next as it drained toward the Utah Lake. Lamond 
		remembers a trip to the lake after chores when they all went for a swim. 
		He says: “Mom wanted to go so we took the long-tailed buggy with Old 
		Bert to pull it. We all rode until we got to the Green Knoll (a soft 
		peat bog). We all got out except Mom and Cub, a young dog who was 
		bobtailed and looked like a cub bear, hence the name. We all stood 
		watching to see if Old Bert could pull the buggy through the soft spot. 
		The going was a bit slow, so we all tried to help. The buggy was almost 
		through, when someone looked for cub, couldn’t see him, and asked, 
		“Where’s Cub?” We all began looking for the dog, including Mother who 
		was still in the buggy. Cub was not to be seen. Then Mom saw a movement 
		in the mud at the side of the buggy, took hold of the thing moving and 
		pulled. She brought Cub up out of the mud. She had hold of his stubby 
		little tail. Cub was so happy that he ran to each one of us and showed 
		his appreciation by shaking mud all over us. But when we got the buggy 
		through the bog and to the Lake, we soon took care of Cub. We had many 
		dogs but remember some more than others. Old Grover, the dog that was 
		with Leslie when he was bitten by the rattlesnake, had a whammy on 
		coyotes. He could out-run them and would run along side until the coyote 
		would turn to snap at him, and then Grover would get a throat hold on 
		the coyote by coming up under the snap. Scratch one coyote! Later Grover 
		got into a fight with a female wolf at Uncle Steve’s place on the bench 
		and got the licking of his life. He never would chase coyote again. I 
		also remember as a child when we lived for a short time in a house near 
		the Lehi Beet Factory, that Dad and Mom wanted to go to a dance one 
		night and had Aunt Emma come from Lake View to take care of me. Emma was 
		nervous about being so near the Factory with all the men working there. 
		Dad told her that she did not have to worry, that Old Grover would take 
		care of her. She wasn’t so sure. Dad told her to go upstairs and put on 
		different clothing, come back, and see what Grover would do. Aunt Emma 
		did as Dad suggested. As she started down the stairs, Grover got up and 
		started toward the foot of the stairs, with hair standing up on his 
		back. As Aunt Emma took a step down, Grover took a step forward; he did 
		not give an inch. Grover began a low-throated growl. Then Dad spoke to 
		him and said, “It’s alright Grover.” Grover went back to his spot and 
		laid down. Aunt Emma was not afraid after that. We also had a mongrel 
		black and white dog we named Jack. Jack had some rather unusual 
		pastimes. In the spring of the year, he would follow up and down the 
		drainage ditch that emptied into the Mud Slough, and watch for carp (a 
		big fish). When he would see a carp, he would jump head first into the 
		ditch, sink his teeth into the back of the carp, bring it onto the bank 
		of the ditch and leave it. He would then look for more carp. He didn’t 
		eat them but seemed to enjoy catching them. Jack would also hunt skunks 
		and porcupines. Nearly ever summer, he was sprayed so often by skunks 
		that we could hardly stand him around. He never did learn to either 
		handle porcupines or leave them alone. He nose and mouth were often 
		“loaded” with quills. Once we had to chloroform him to remove over 400 
		quills from his nose and mouth. He never fully recovered from the 
		infection that followed. I (Lamond still speaking) recall one of the 
		real thrills of my life that came while we lived at Grandma Percia’s 
		house while the creamery on the new site was being built. Leona and I 
		were playing on the west side of the road in front of Grandma’s, when we 
		heard a noise coming from the south. We looked down the road and there 
		came Uncle Alf Johnson’s team running for home as fast as they could go. 
		The tongue was broken and hitting the road, and then bouncing up and 
		hitting first one horse and then the other. I pulled Leona under the 
		fence as they passed and had just stood up, when here came Dad with Old 
		Bert and the long-tailed buggy. (A long-tailed buggy, so called, was 
		actually a type of small wagon with a seat across the front end and two 
		tongues so that a horse could be hitched between them to pull it. There 
		was also a cover that went over the tops that was similar to the square, 
		flat buggy tops.) Dad was whipping Old Bert trying to catch the 
		runaways. Dad had been missing butter and had his sleeves rolled to his 
		shoulders, showing his well-muscled arms, his shirt open at the collar, 
		and not a hair of his black curly hair was out of place. Dad chased the 
		runaways, to Lars Jacobsen’s place, got in front of them and gradually 
		forced them against the fence, then he yelled “Whoa at Old Bert, threw 
		the lines, and jumped out and grabbed the bridles of the team from in 
		front. Bert stopped on the spot even though he had been whipped a few 
		minutes before. Dad had trained him to do this on command. I don’t think 
		I was ever more proud of my Dad. In the early days of Dad’s fishing, 
		when we lived at the Old Factory Farm, he used to grabble suckers in the 
		river. The suckers could get a pretty good size. Dad rigged up an 
		especially strong tackle to work with. One day he hooked two big trout. 
		One went east and one went west. The one Dad saved weighed 13 ¾ pounds 
		dressed and when he laid it on the table, the head was beyond one side 
		and the tail on the other side.” The first automobile purchased was made 
		by Studebaker, called an EMF. Leslie bought it from his brother, Vern 
		Bunnell, who had become an auto salesman. This was around 1911 or 1912. 
		Not knowing what the initials “EMF” stood for, the family soon found 
		names to fit the title…Every-Morning-Fix-it…because it seemed to 
		continually need some type of repair. In those days, one purchased a 
		number for the life of the car. The number of the EMF was painted on the 
		lower back corner…#2463, meaning, of course, that the auto was the two 
		thousand four hundred and sixty-third car sold in the State of Utah. 
		LeRoy recalls going to Salt Lake with his Dad and mother in the EMF and 
		seeing the permanent license of #8 painted on the back of the 
		automobile. This meant that they saw the eighth car sold in the State. 
		LeRoy remembers the following: “In 1915 Dad decided to take Mother and 
		Elvin (3 years old) to visit Uncle Vern and Aunt Edith, who had moved to 
		Twin Falls, Idaho. In those days the roads were not paved. It required 
		four days each was to make the journey. As I remember, Dad took bedding 
		and food along and they camped out at night. Between Snowville, Utah and 
		Burley, Idaho, the petcock on the radiator was “turned” as the car went 
		over the high sagebrush in the middle of the road. The water drained out 
		of the radiator. Dad had to walk until he found water (I think some 
		sheepherder came to his rescue). I can remember Mother telling of how 
		frightened she was that night as the three of them slept under the stars 
		and the coyotes howled and seemed to come closer and closer. The EMF 
		needed a major overhaul when they arrived in Twin Falls and another one 
		when they arrived back home. Tires, at the time, for the car were smooth 
		tread and were supposed to be guaranteed for 3,500 miles, but the 
		guarantee wasn’t worth anything. Later Dad went back to Twin Falls to 
		work with Uncle Vern for a summer selling cars. By this time, the old 
		EMF was ready for scrap heap. Dad invested in a secondhand Dodge that he 
		drove home. Later he bought a Model T Ford. Dad loved to go fishing and 
		as we boys grew older and could do more of the farm chores, he had more 
		time. He built a two-room lumber “summer” home at Strawberry, which he 
		made good use of. Sometimes Mother went with him but usually she urged 
		Dad to take one of us boys.” LeRoy also recalls the Flu epidemic of 1917 
		and 1918 that wasn’t too serious for the family, although Irwin caught 
		the flu on the “fly.” “It was fall and we boys were putting up alfalfa 
		hay,” recalls LeRoy. “We were using a hay loader that had been left at 
		the farm by some implement dealer who had tried to sell it to Dad for a 
		beet top loader. The implement would not work as a beet top loader and 
		Dad refused to buy it. Since this loader was just sitting there, we boys 
		decided to try it on the light hay crop to save us some work. We had had 
		a long open fall and were fortunate to get a fourth crop of alfalfa. We 
		found that the loader worked very well on the hay. I was forking the hay 
		forward from the loader; Irwin placed the hay at the front end of the 
		wagon; Karl stood on the double trees of the wagon to drive the horses. 
		Just as we were putting that “one more forkful” on the already high 
		load, Karl thought of something he wanted to say to me, and by 
		coincidence, shouted ‘Roy’, just seconds after Irwin had placed a 
		forkful of hay on the right front corner of the load, then stepping over 
		on the corner to “firm” they hay. The word ‘Roy’ as shouted, sounded 
		like ‘Whoa’ to the horses, and not wanting to overlook any rests, the 
		horses stopped suddenly. Irwin did not. He didn’t expect the stop, was 
		over-balanced, fell forward and down the 9 or 10 feet to the ground, 
		striking on the back of his head and shoulders to the right side of the 
		team. I saw him fall and was on the ground almost as soon as he was. 
		Karl and I took him to the house and called the Doctor. The Doctor 
		arrived, took one look at Irwin and said, “Isolate him at once, he has 
		the flu!” We still tease Irwin that the fastest way to catch the flu is 
		to fly through the air. Needless to say, Irwin recovered after a few 
		days of rest. Without doing anymore “flying,” Irwin was the first to 
		come home with the flu in the all of 1918. The germ passed around among 
		most of the family. I do not remember the order in which we took sick, 
		but within a few days, the folks had Irwin, my married sister, Leona, 
		and her husband (James A. Nuttall), Karl, Vinna, and myself to nurse. 
		Fortunately, Dad Mother, and Levin did not take it. Evlin was about 
		seven years old and wasn’t much help to Dad, who had all the chores to 
		do alone, beside helping mother with all of us. Dad had more than 10 
		cows to milk by hand, night and morning along with all the other chores. 
		It was impossible to hire help, man or woman, as other families had 
		their problems, too. As I recall, over half of the families in the ward 
		were sick at the same time we were. There had already been a number of 
		deaths including Uncle Bill Goodridge, husband of my mother’s sister, 
		Josephine. Most people were either too busy taking care of their own 
		sick or too frightened to enter a home where anyone was ill. In families 
		where all of them were sick, those least sick would get up to try to 
		help others, and in so ding, often suffered setbacks, and many of them 
		died. The flu was extremely contagious. So serious was the epidemic that 
		all people who left their homes were compelled to wear masks, which 
		consisted of several thicknesses of muslin put together in about a four 
		inch square pad and tied over the nose and mouth. All schools, churches, 
		social gatherings, or any type of meetings were forbidden for months. 
		People who had to go to town shopping were urged to stay four feet or 
		more away from other shoppers, if at all possible. The flu killed 21 
		million 1918 with 500,000 of them being in the United States. The normal 
		death rate rocketed 700 percent. In some of the large cities, flu 
		victims who dropped in the streets lay there all day and sometimes 
		longer. Fortunately, in our family, the damage was light. Irwin suffered 
		some damage to his heart but this seemed to disappear in about a year. 
		Merrill was not at home as he was on a mission ot the North Western 
		States and Lamond had married and was living in Boise, Idaho (or maybe 
		it was Twin Falls.” Leslie had the Old Model T Ford remodeled into a 
		truck to take to Strawberry fishing. Leslie had a favorite story that he 
		often told about the old Ford. On one occasion when he was driving to 
		Strawberry to go fishing, he was near the last section of very narrow 
		road passing between the main Provo Canyon and the widened area into the 
		Charelston and Heber Valley, there was a very narrow section of road, in 
		the early days, that had the Provo River on one side and a straight up 
		mountain side on the other. As Leslie approached a very, very narrow 
		corner in the road, he met a car coming form the other direction. There 
		seemed no possibility of passing and not time enough to stop either car. 
		Leslie said that both drivers “narrowed” up their cars, turned out for 
		each other as much as they could on the narrow one-car road, and passed 
		each other. He laughed and re0told the story each time he passed that 
		corner. LeRoy was with his father on a fishing trip to Strawberry when 
		the following incident occurred: LeRoy says: “We were on the return trip 
		from Strawberry and had reached the head of Daniel’s Canyon where the 
		road (then) was steep and narrow. We had just started to descend when we 
		met an out-of-state car. There was room to pass if each car kept to his 
		side of the road. However, the driver of the other car stopped in the 
		middle of the road, got out of his car, came to our car, and side, “I 
		refuse to turn out to the right side (which was his rightful side, but 
		was the outside lane with a very steep grade to the bottom of the 
		canyon) as I have a NEW car. I will pull in next to the mountain and YOU 
		drive your OLD car through on the outside lane!” Dad, usually was a very 
		accommodating person and if the man had said that he was afraid to drive 
		on the outside, I am sure Dad would have agreed but Dad didn’t like the 
		inference that his life and mine and the old truck were more expendable 
		than the man’s life and his new car, plus the man’s dictatorial manner, 
		ruffled Dad. Dad calmly said the he preferred to stay in his own lane, 
		that there was plenty of room for both cars to pass if the man would get 
		back into his own lane. Yet the out-of-stater insisted that Dad must go 
		around him on the wrong side. Dad’s answer to that was, “Then we will be 
		here a long time!” He then proceeded to unpack his tent from the back of 
		the truck. At that, the man reconsidered, moved his car over to the 
		proper land and passed us. When Father knew he was right, no one could 
		move him.” LeRoy experienced another exciting ride with his Dad on the 
		way home form a fishing trip to Strawberry. LeRoy recalls: “On the way 
		home as we were driving down the divide into Daniel’s Canyon, a car 
		whizzed past Dad, then slowed up just enough to keep us eating his dust. 
		The roads were really dusty then as this was long before asphalt was 
		used. When Dad would come to a spot wide enough to pass the car in 
		front, it would pull over in front of us. But Dad, knowing the canyon 
		and the road, watched for his opportunity, and when the time came, he 
		passed the car. Then Dad kept the other car eating our dust all the way 
		down the canyon to the mouth of the canyon where the cutoff road was 
		located that led to Provo Canyon. Dad anticipated what he was going to 
		do, and on reaching the cutoff, he quacking turned into it without 
		having to slow down too much. The other driver, apparently redeyed (and 
		not only form the dust), did not see the corner or realized Dad’s 
		intentions soon enough, tried to follow Dad…but the chase was over. The 
		pursuing car stopped rather suddenly. Apparently, he did not see the 
		ditch when he tried to negotiate the turn.” Leslie and Ellen loved their 
		children and the children knew they could always count on their parents 
		for advice and help in any form needed. They taught the children that 
		“to work” was honorable, but one should have fun, too. Now that the 
		children are grown up, they maintain that the program sponsored by the 
		LDS Church of having a Family Home Evening originated and was put to 
		practical use around the big table in the kitchen of the new home. It 
		was here that they munched popcorn while they studied. It was here that 
		many incidents happened that have been relived whenever two or more of 
		the children get together, such as: the saying “ought time five is 
		nothing and one is six” or listening to Yage (Irwin) speak out with, 
		“Haint? Hain’t ain’t a word!” Or laughing about the time Otie (Merrill) 
		slid off the Old Chick Sales (outside toilet) and caught his pants on a 
		nail, turned upside down and broke his arm when he hit the ground: or 
		Frog (LeRoy) as a youngster, watching his Dad and Merrill nailing boards 
		at the top of the new barn, looked up, as swiftly moving clouds came in 
		his range of vision and shouted, “Oh, Papa, the barn is falling!” and 
		Otie left his place on the barn and was on the ground in an instant; or 
		Frog when the load of hay tipped over and covered him up, yelling, “Her 
		I am!” fearing that someone might shove a fork in him while looking for 
		him; or Skinny (Elvin) sitting on top of the hayshed fixing the fork 
		carrier, saying, “If I am up here much longer, I will be legs almighty 
		and crotch eternal,” or Merrill jumping over the hedge, landing on his 
		hands, and then walking off on his hands. Merrill was perhaps the best 
		athlete of the family but he needed all his ability when the Ram took 
		after him; or Merrill looking in the eyes of Old Rock, a horse, and 
		saying, “I can see the devil in your eye!” then realizing it was his own 
		reflection; Leona arguing with Leslie about wearing lipstick; Irwin 
		getting amorous; Kow (Karl) telling Leslie about the tree he saw; Din 
		(Vinna) coming home from Salt Lake and cleaning house for Ellen and how 
		much Ellen appreciated it; and Nig’s (Lamond) bilious spells. Lamond 
		tells about the last bilious spell that he remembers, (he usually had 
		one every summer). He recalls, “I would come down with a high fever and 
		asked for many “cold drinks. I was upstairs in the south bedroom. At 
		bedtime, I asked for another cold drink which Mother brought, and then 
		said that this one was the lat I could have.” But I could hear the water 
		running in the south well and knew how cold it could be and how good it 
		would taste. So when everybody was asleep, I slipped down, got a glass, 
		went out to the well, and drank all I could hold. Then I went back to 
		bed. I couldn’t sleep and began to think how good a watermelon would 
		taste. Again I got out of bed, went to the melon patch, picked out a 
		melon, busted it open, sat there in the patch and ate most of it before 
		I went back to bed. When Dad called the other boys to get up and milk 
		the cows, I got up and helped. But it wasn’t until after I was married 
		that I told Mom about it.” The family recreational activities ran the 
		gamut of good clean fun. There was walking on the steel tank up and down 
		the bath to the road, walking on stilts, walking on tin cans, playing 
		with the dogs and the many cats, having private track meets on the 
		shores of Utah Lake, LeRoy going for a swim in Utah lake on New Years 
		Day, the ball games on Wednesday afternoons with the Lake View Athletic 
		Association in charge. The Ward scheduled the Wednesday gams so the boys 
		wouldn’t play ball on Sundays and it worked for a number of years. Then 
		there was the great gang of young people in the neighborhood with whom 
		the boys played “Run, Sheep, Run,” “Steel Sticks,” “Hide and Seek,” and 
		last but not least, the Ghost stories told around a camp fire, holding 
		hands, and then being afraid to go home. What a glorious time in which 
		to grow up. In 1929, a man by the name of Wilson, called on Leslie and 
		extolled the exorbitant amount of money that people were making by 
		raising foxes. Leslie finally decided to try it, thinking it would give 
		him another “hobby” for his later years. He loved all animals, wild or 
		tame, and had a way of getting their confidence. As LeRoy recalls, 
		Leslie bought one or more pair of silver foxes and several pairs of blue 
		foxes. He paid $1600 for each pair of the silver ones and around $800 
		for the blues. He had to borrow the money as the foxes were not the only 
		expense. He had to build individual pens for each pair plus another 
		outside fence that enclosed not only the pens he needed but left room 
		for more individual pens to be added as his foxes increased. Each pen 
		was made out of 8 feet wire fencing with an 18 inch lean-to at the top. 
		The outside fence was not only 8 feet high with the leaning fence at the 
		top but it had to have several inches of wire buried in the ground at 
		the bottom so the foxes could not dig out if they should get out of 
		their individual pens… The foxes had to be fed once a day with meat 
		(usually horse meta) that had to be ground in a hand grinder and this 
		was not only time consuming but very tiring. But true to form, Leslie 
		enjoyed most of it, as he had a new challenge. It wasn’t too long until 
		he had one of the foxes riding his shoulder as a cat would. The silver 
		fox would follow him around and play with him. He even trained one of 
		the dogs to accept the fox and the fox to play with the dog. The two 
		would play together on the front lawn much to the amazement of friends 
		and passersby. The fox made no attempt to run away. One day Leslie was 
		in the Barber Shop in town and heard a man tell of setting his traps in 
		Skipper Bay where he caught muskrats. The mas was puzzled because he 
		kept finding that some animal was eating the muskrats in the traps. He 
		had found strange tracks around the trap but had no idea what animal 
		made the tracks. Then one morning, when Leslie went to feed his foxes, 
		he found one with a trap on his foot. Remembering the story he had heard 
		in the Barber Shop, he surmised that his fox had been the culprit. He 
		couldn’t understand how the fox was able to leave the pen and finally 
		caught him climbing over the top. In 1929 when Leslie went into the fox 
		business, pelts were selling for $100 a pelt. He didn’t anticipate the 
		depression that his in 1930 when the highest price he could get for a 
		prime silver fox pelt was $15. This was a blow to the family but by 
		cutting back on everything possible with the whole family participating, 
		they hung on for a number of years but when the depression lingered, and 
		the price of pelts went lower with the demand for them almost 
		non-existent, Leslie had to go out of the business or lose the farm. It 
		wasn’t too long after this that he put the farm in Elvin’s hands and 
		retired from active management although he was there when needed. All of 
		the boys but Elvin had married by this time. Leslie had been a Deputy 
		Game Warden for about twenty years when he and LeRoy had an interesting 
		experience. LeRoy tells it like this: “I was teaching Vocational 
		Agriculture in Payson and returned one Saturday to the farm for the 
		opening of the pheasant season. The hunting was to open at noon. Dad and 
		I walked down to Skipper’s Bay before noon so that we would be ready 
		when it was time to hunt. As we waited, we heard a number of shots in 
		the distance. As they continued closer to us, Dad went to investigate. 
		Someone was shooting before they should. I went along with him. We soon 
		saw three boys of high school age who were shooting at every bird they 
		saw. It was still half-an-hour before noon. As we approached the boys, I 
		lagged behind some thirty or forty yards to let Dad do the talking. He 
		walked up to the boys and asked why they were shooting before the 
		hunting season was officially opened. The boys were carrying birds, both 
		rooster and hens with them. As Dad asked the question, one smart aleck 
		boy made an insinuating remark that Dad could not and would not 
		tolerate. He grabbed the boy, who resisted, but Dad threw him to the 
		ground and proceeded to take his gun away from him. The boy on the 
		ground called out to his companions, “Shoot the _ _ _ (s.o.b.)!” one of 
		the boys started to raise his gun toward Dad, but I had a bead on him 
		and sharply called out, “Drop it!” and he dropped his gun. The boys were 
		officially arrested by Dad. But the matter didn’t end there. The boy 
		whose gun Dad had taken, went to an attorney by the name of Martin M. 
		Larsen and swore out a complaint against Dad, saying that Dad struck 
		him, a minor. Larsen was the type of attorney who would handle such 
		cases. Dad was called into court and I went as his witness. Of course, 
		Dad was acquitted when the evidence was presented. It was also proved at 
		t this time that the boys were using stolen ammunition. It was too bad 
		that the boy didn’t learn from this experience. He went on to commit 
		some crime (later) in California and while attempting to escape from the 
		police as he fled into Arizona, he was shot and killed. Leslie and Ellen 
		were blessed with unusually good health most of their lives, inspite of 
		Ellen having an operation for gall stones, and the fact that thse 
		developed diabetes and to have insulin shots (which Elvin faithfully 
		gave her); and she also recovered from an appendectomy when she was in 
		her early seventies. For over thirty years, Leslie complained of a 
		nagging pain in his side. He consulted many Doctors but not one could 
		determine the cause. The pain forced him to be selective in the type of 
		work and activities in which he could participate. Then he became very 
		sleepy and began sleeping most of the day and night. He would go to 
		sleep while eating at the table, or in the middle of a sentence as he 
		talked with family and friends. Finally, when in his 70s, one doctor, 
		having checked every way he knew, asked if Leslie had any teeth left. 
		Leslie said that he had just four teeth. The Doctor, as a last resort, 
		suggested that Leslie have them pulled. The teeth were extracted and 
		Leslie awakened and had no more trouble. The sons and daughters of 
		Leslie and Ellen tried to have a family reunion each summer in the grove 
		to which everyone made an effort to attend, even though they visited 
		individually often. The children wanted to give their parents a Golden 
		Wedding Reception but Ellen didn’t feel quite up to it in 1942. The 
		family gathered to spend a wonderful day together. Many friends and 
		neighbors also called during the day and evening. In 1947, the family 
		again came together to celebrate the 55th wedding anniversary of their 
		parents. The Provo paper published the wedding picture of Leslie and 
		Ellen and gave an account of their first wedding reception. The article 
		went on to say: “One of the oldest families of the Lakeview area, the 
		Bunnells, recall much of the early community life. They recall the 
		trolley that ran down Main Street carrying townspeople to celebration at 
		the old Utah lake resort. They remember trips across Utah Lake in 
		bobsleighs to bring back cedar posts, with many near casualties when the 
		ice would break. In their time they have ridden behind oxen, in 
		horse-drawn vehicles, automobiles, the train of early times, the 
		streamliner and finally the giant airliner. The Bunnells flew to New 
		York a few weeks ago. Mr. Bunnell was a student at BY Academy, studying 
		under Karl G. Maeser. The sons and daughters have studied at BYU. They 
		are: L. Lamond Bunell, Salt Lake City; Mrs. James (Leona) Nuttall, 
		Ephraim; Merrill J Bunnell, Larchmont, New York; LeRoy Bunnell, 
		Tremonton; Mrs. Fred (Vinna) Bunnell, Midvale; Karl Bunnell, Irwin 
		Bunnell, and Elvin Bunnell, Lakeview. There are 25 grandchildren and 12 
		great grandchildren. Today family members will gather on the spacious 
		lawns at the Bunnell home to celebrate the 55th anniversary. Plans are 
		complete for a family picnic, games, pictures and visiting.” The 
		children had tried for years to coax Leslie and Ellen to fly to New York 
		City to visit Merrill and family. Ellen was willing but Leslie didn’t 
		want to get his feet off the ground, but when two tickets were purchased 
		and presented to him, Leslie thought that all that money would be wasted 
		unless he used the tickets, so he consented to go. Ellen enjoyed the 
		flight. Flying above the fleecy clouds, she let her imagination soar and 
		saw beauty in the storm that kept their plane circling the New York 
		airport for two hours before the pilot announced that landing conditions 
		were still so unstable at JFK, New York city, the plane was going to the 
		Newark, N.J. airport to land. Leslie had been nervous all the way and 
		when the storm and weather condition kept them circling at JFK, he was 
		ready to jump out of the plane…anything to get back on the good old 
		earth. As they flew toward Newark, he was sure the plane would run out 
		of gas, or collide with another circling plane, and that Merrill would 
		never be able to find them at Newark, etc. But Merrill was waiting when 
		the plane landed and there was a happy reunion. However, Leslie refused 
		to return home by air. Merrill, understanding his anxiety, purchased 
		Pullman (bedroom) tickets on the Streamliner (train) and Leslie and 
		Ellen returned safely and happily with two more modes of transportation 
		added to their long list. When Ellen died on the 4th January 1949 and 
		left Leslie a very young seventy-nine year old man, Leslie couldn’t seem 
		to adjust to life without her and failed in health rapidly. He spent 
		much of the ten months after Ellen’s death under the Doctor’s care, and 
		hospitals, and died the 10th November, 1949, an old, old man. Leona 
		concluded her recollections with the following poem, which she said, 
		“Expresses my feelings for my parents. Although it was written for a 
		father, it applies equally to a mother, especially ours.” All of the 
		children would agree with her. YOU FOLLOW A FAMOUS FATHER You follow a 
		famous father, his honor is yours to share, He gave you a name that was 
		free from shame, A name he was proud to bear. He lived in the morning 
		sunlight, And marched in the ranks for right, He was always true to the 
		best he knew And the shield that he wore was bright. You follow a famous 
		father, not known to the printed page Nor written down in the World’s 
		renown, As a prince of his little age. But never a stain was attached to 
		him, And never any shame And he was happy to give to you, The pride of 
		an honest name. You follow a famous father, and never a day goes by But 
		you feel that he looks down on you To carry his standards high. He stood 
		to the sternest trials As only a brave man can Though the way be long, 
		you must never wrong The name of so good a man. You follow a famous 
		father and him you must keep in mind, Though his form be gone, you must 
		carry on The name that he left behind. It was yours on that the day he 
		gave it, It shone as a monarch’s crown; And as fair to see as it came to 
		thee, It must be, when you put it down. (Author unknown)<br />
