		The descendants of Francis Peay trace their roots back across the ocean 
		to the country of Sussex England. Here on September 23, 1825, Francis 
		was born in the parish of Felpham located a few miles north of the 
		English Channel. His father William Peay was born January 1, 1795 i 
		Yapton, a parish not far from Felpham. He married Charlotte Suter on 
		July 13, 1814 and they had three children, William, Mary Ann and 
		Charles. Charlotte and Charles passed away in 1820. William the married 
		Mary Blake, daughter of Francis and Mary Wingate, on May 13, 1820. 
		William and Mary had a son, James Alfred in Yapton. They moved to Ankton 
		a hamlet in Felpham where Francis, his brother Edward and sisters Louisa 
		and Frances were born. William occupation at the time was listed as a 
		laborer. The sixth child, Elizabeth Jane was born in Yapton and died an 
		infant. Before 1837 the family moved to Climping, a short distance from 
		Felpham, where George Thomas and Emily were born. As a boy of seven, 
		Francis was apprenticed out to a ship builder. This became his trade. 
		When he was 17 years of age his father became ill and on the 18th of 
		April 1843, died in Chinchester Hospital and was buried at the Yapton 
		Church Yard, eleven miles away. About the fall of the year 1845 his 
		brother James Alfred got a job at the Portmouth Dockyard as a ship 
		carpenter. Some months later Francis got a pass to the government dock 
		yard as coalker and they sent for their mother and family to make their 
		home on Portmouth, Hampshire County. James Alfred married Ann Groften in 
		June 1846 and they had a baby daughter. July 4, James died at Portmouth 
		leaving his widow and child. The same month and place Emily the youngest 
		sister died at four years of age. In his young manhood he was married to 
		Prudence Collyer. They had two little sons. His happiness with his wife 
		and sons was very short, for the family took scarlet fever and his wife 
		and both sons died within a few days of each other, and her was ill at 
		the same time. Prudence was a dressmaker and her father was John Collyer 
		who was a bricklayer. Francis was 23 years old when he accepted the 
		Gospel of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints and was baptized on January 
		1, 1849 by Edward Davies and confirmed by James Scaffold. His mother, 
		brothers Edward and George and sister Frances also joined the church the 
		same year. It was his mother's wish to bring her children to America and 
		dwell in Zion with the Saints. So, on the 19th of January 1851 Edward, 
		George, sister Frances and mother boarded a ship for America. Francis 
		remained behind to earn money for his journey over. Francis came to 
		America on January 23, 1853 with the sixty-second company of saints on 
		the ship &quot;Golcondo&quot;. While on board ship he fell in love with Eliza Jane 
		Baker (born May 18, 1834 in Poole, England, Dorset County, the daughter 
		of Jeremiah Thomas and Mary Ann Harden Bake. He had met her before and 
		they were married on board ship by Elder Jacob Gates. In the account of 
		the &quot;Golcondo&quot; in church emigration file the following is recorded; 
		&quot;After a prosperous voyage of 44 days the &quot;Golcondo&quot; arrived at the 
		Balixe, at the mouth of the Mississippi River, where they waited 12 days 
		for a steam tug to take them up to New Orleans. During the voyage half 
		hour's storm despoiled the gallant vessel of her three top masts. Four 
		births, two marriages and two deaths occurred on board: the health of 
		the saints was very good generally during the entire passage. The 
		conduct of Captain Kerr gave great satisfaction to all the company, and 
		before parting a vote of thanks, with three cheers was tendered him. &quot;On 
		the 26th of March the vessel arrived safely in New Orleans, where the 
		emigrants boarded the steam-packed &quot;Illinois&quot;, on which they continued 
		the journey to St. Louis, Missouri, and thence soon afterwards to 
		Keokuk, Iowa.&quot; There were 232 adults, 80 children between the ages of 
		one an fourteen and nine infants who made the trip. Francis and Eliza 
		Jane arrived in Provo on October 10, 1853. Francis was sad to find that 
		his mother, Mary, had passed away shortly after she arrived in Provo on 
		March 18, 1853. They took a homestead in the southwestern part of Provo. 
		During the Indian trouble, they had to move into the fort, but as soon 
		as the trouble was settled, they went back to the farm. Their first 
		house was made of adobe, the adobe made by himself and family, and the 
		roof was thatched with rushes that were hauled from the shores of Utah 
		Lake. The house consisted of two rooms with an upstairs that was just 
		one very large room with a stairway on the outside of the house. Later 
		they built another two story adobe home west of the first home and his 
		son Will lived in the old home with his wife and family Francis and 
		Eliza were blessed with twelve children. The first child, Prudence was 
		born March 7, 1854; Francis Alfred was born on December 23, 1856; Eliza 
		Jane was born January 25, 1858; Mary Louisa was born February 23, 1860; 
		Emily Ann, born July 30 1862; William Baker born January 8, 1865; Walter 
		Blake born July 12 1867; Arthur Edwin was born August 9, 1869. Sadness 
		came to their lives at this time as Eliza Jane their thirteen year old 
		daughter died on September 21, 1871. On November 3, 1871, Rosetta 
		Priscilla was born. A son Freddie was born January 3, 1874 but he only 
		lived till September 28 and died when only nine months old. Lily Frances 
		was born August 12, 1875 and the following November 7, Mary Louisa 
		passed away when she was fifteen years old. Their twelfth child, Parly 
		Gilbert was born December 28, 1877 and only lived for a little over two 
		years and died January 29,1880. Francis was a hard worker and a good 
		farmer. He raised bees and had a house especially built where he 
		extracted and took care of the honey. His son Will took care of the bees 
		also and they called him &quot;Honey Will&quot;. Francis had cows and raised food 
		for them as well as his family. He raised wonderful vegetables and had 
		all kinds of fruit. His daughter, Lily has told many times of how fast 
		the cups would fill with strawberries by just staying in one spot and 
		they were large quart cups, the small ones were unknown at that time. 
		Many of the trees were still standing when the place was sold and the 
		grandchildren and great grandchildren have enjoyed apples, grapes, 
		cherries and mulberries. He built drying sheds that were full of 
		shelves. When the fruit came on it was first prepared for drying and 
		every day or so each piece had to be turned so it would dry evenly. What 
		a tedious task it must have been to tune thousand of pieces until they 
		were sufficiently dry and ready for storage. They had huge crocks in 
		those days to put their dry fruit. They didn't have coops for the 
		chickens so they could be locked up, so the children would have to go 
		out in knee deep snow to gather eggs that were laid in the straw stack 
		or hay or anywhere they chanced to lay their eggs. They had a big cellar 
		to store all of their produce and it was large enough to drive a team 
		and wagon into it. In addition to raising all kinds of fruits and 
		vegetables, he raised flax and made his own rope from it. They also 
		raised sheep and carded their own wool to make quilts etc. On March 25, 
		1870, Francis received a patent for a quarter section of ground which 
		was 160 acres. This land was where he had built his home and farm at 
		approximately 1000 west to 1400 west on the north side of 600 South. 
		Francis was a minute man during the Indian trouble. They would cut down 
		the fences and ride over the crops. One day he and his boys were out in 
		the field and a band of Indians cam and began to cut down the fence. He 
		called for them to stop, and one of them shot at him, the arrow passing 
		through hi hat. This made him angry, and he grabbed a pitch fork and 
		rushed towards them. They climbed on their horses and rode away. They 
		found he was not afraid of them, so that ended the trouble. The Indian 
		were very poor and would come to the homes and beg for food and things. 
		Francis and his wife were always generous and gave them whatever they 
		asked for. Francis was also interested in promoting mining and did much 
		prospecting and hauling supplies to the Tintic District for the Miners. 
		He spent much hard earned money prospecting in the hills east of Provo. 
		His daughter Lily had a tiny gold nugget from one of the mines. Francis 
		as a faithful Latter-day Saint always paying a full tithe and doing his 
		share of work for the growth of the church. he was ordained to the 34th 
		Quorum of Seventies on May 17, 1857. They were a close family, full of 
		love for one another and their fellow man and for the beauty of nature 
		and things put her by God for good. The children loved to sit on the 
		porch in the evenings and have their mother and father sing to them. 
		They had good voices and were lovers of music. Francis led the choir for 
		several years. On January 26, 1869, Francis and Eliza received their 
		endowments in the Endowment house. This must have meant a great deal to 
		them for they left their homes in England that they might come to Zion 
		and partake of the blessing of the gospel. However, something went 
		wrong. For according to the second ward record Francis was 
		disfellowshiped on September 13, 1866 for &quot;contempt of the Priesthood 
		and non-payment of meeting house tax.&quot; He was given notice to meet with 
		the Bishop for investigation as to why he hadn't paid his tax. He did 
		not show up nor explain why, so he was disfellowshiped from the church. 
		It seems that he became associated with a group that felt that some of 
		the leaders were getting too much power in the temporal affairs of the 
		saints and spoke out against polygamy. Consequently, on December 19, 
		1869 he was excommunicated for &quot;apostasy in favor of God be and 
		Harrison.&quot; His daughter, Lily said that when they came and told him that 
		he had been cut off from the church he looked as if he had received a 
		death blow and it almost broke his heart. Helen Weeks, a great 
		granddaughter, writes the following: &quot;Mama remembers their farm having 
		lots of trees on it with a creek running through. It was a lovely two 
		story home of adobe brick. Grandfather had a firm testimony of the 
		gospel. He was a man of firm convictions. he was well-read. He and his 
		wife were quiet people and didn't converse much but grandfather often 
		had visitors, doctors and lawyers, people of good education came and 
		visited him for they appreciated his keen intellect. Grandma always made 
		hot bread for lunch. After having his lunch grandfather would retire to 
		his room or garden and read for a while each day. He was a man of high 
		principles. Francis died May 5, 1904 and was buried in Provo. His wife 
		spent the last years of her life with her daughter Prudence in Vineyard. 
		&quot;Francis and Eliza Jane Baker were refined, cultured, intelligent 
		people. They wee hard-working, industrious people. They left a wonderful 
		posterity and it is to them we owe a great debt of gratitude for having 
		come to America and thus making it possible for us to live in this 
		beautiful land.&quot; written by Lorraine R. Homan, great granddaughter</span><br />
