		<strong>Story of the Life of Shadrach Holdaway <br />
		</strong><br />
		The information we have on the early life of Shadrach Holdaway is very 
		limited. He was born 15 October 1822 in Hawkins County, Tennessee, son 
		of Timothy and Mary Trent Holdaway. His parents moved from Tennessee to 
		Indiana about l833 as their youngest son, Daniel Webster, was born in 
		Greencastle, Putnam Co., Indiana, 14 July 1854. <br />
		<br />
		His father died in 1835, probably in Illinois, as we know his mother 
		married William H. Lunceford 2 Nov 1857 in St. Clair Co., Illinois. Mr. 
		Lunceford was a widower with a large family. Shedrick joined the Church 
		of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 30 April 1843 and that fall went to 
		Nauvoo, remaining there until the Saints were driven out by the mob in 
		1846. <br />
		<br />
		While in Council Bluffs the call came for 500 men to volunteer for the 
		War with Mexico and Shedrick Holdaway was one of them. He filled the 
		position of teamster for Company C of the Mormon Battalion under Captain 
		James Brown and Lieutenant Rosencrans. He was with the Company during 
		the entire campaign until they were discharged from service 16 July 1847 
		at Los Angeles, after which time he spent six months working for Dan 
		Williams. <br />
		<br />
		He bought a team and wagon and had made preparations to join the saints 
		in Utah when the news of the gold discovery was brought to Los Angeles. 
		On his way home he stopped for a little while at the Forks of the 
		American River where he did a little mining and took out about three 
		thousand dollars worth of gold dust. <br />
		<br />
		From books and the reproduction on the screen of life in California 
		during the gold rush, we gain a rather perfect idea of the lawlessness 
		that prevailed. In the camp where he stayed he said that a night seldom 
		passed without a man being killed either in a drunken brawl or by one of 
		the few Spanish women who were in camp. Because he would not mingle with 
		such a group but was sober and decent, he was disliked by some, 
		especially a Spanish woman who resented his indifference. He had boasted 
		that she would get him yet. He said that one night he awoke from a sound 
		sleep as he heard his mother call &quot;Shedrick, Shedrick, Shedrick.@ He 
		interpreted that to be warning as his mother was still in Illinois, and 
		he immediately arose and left the camp and started for Salt Lake. <br />
		<br />
		He arrived in the valley 24 October 1848 with three thousand dollars in 
		gold dust and was the first man to pay his tithing in California gold 
		dust. <br />
		<br />
		On 24 December 1848 Shedrick married Lucinda Haws, daughter of Gilberth 
		and Hannah Whitcomb Haws in the Endowment House. The Haws family had 
		arrived in the Salt Lake Valley 23 September 1848. <br />
		<br />
		Taken from Bentwet, Edna H. Holdaway History and Genealogy. Salt Lake 
		City: Filmed by the Genealogical Society of Utah, 1977. Pages 18-22. 
		Film: FHL US/CAN Film 982437 item #2. <br />
		<br />
		This history compiled by Granddaughters Clothield Young Newren and Edna 
		H. Bentwet. Soon after their marriage Shedrick and Lucinda went East, 
		but let us get the story of the trip from Lucinda's autobiography 
		written when she was 79 years old. Having told of her marriage she 
		Holdaway 2 goes on: <br />
		<br />
		The following March, 1849, my father and family, together with thirty 
		other families were called to go south to Utah Valley to settle up that 
		part of the country. I did not go as I intended going back to the States 
		with my husband in May to get some machinery for making woolen goods. We 
		left Salt Lake City in company with thirteen others, among them Brother 
		Lorenzo D. Young and wife and Doctor Bernhisel who was going to 
		Washington, D.C. on business. <br />
		<br />
		Ten men of the company intended to stay at the upper crossing of the 
		Platte River to run a ferry to help the emigrants across the river. 
		Brother Young and wife went with us. One day our little company stopped 
		for noon at a place called Independence Rock east of Fort Bridger. After 
		we left this place we found that one of the men had left a lasso at our 
		camping place. Two of the men went back for the lasso and were followed 
		by seven Indians in full chase. When the Indians saw our company they 
		fell back behind a ridge coming up one by one. <br />
		<br />
		They rode along with us for awhile and seeing some buffaloes feeding in 
		the distance, tried to make the understand that they wanted them to 
		chase the buffaloes. They did so and succeeded in killing one. The 
		Indians camped with us over night. During the night our horses stampeded 
		and in the morning all of them were gone. <br />
		<br />
		Sister Young and myself had to remain in camp with those Indians while 
		the men went in search of the horses. But the Indians did not molest us 
		except to try to scare us. One of the old men came up to me and caught 
		hold of me as if he would pull me out of the wagon. I picked up a 
		hatchet and shook it at him and would have hit him if he had not gone 
		away. <br />
		<br />
		Soon the men came back and we were very glad to be safe again. When the 
		Indians left us they pushed one of the men off his horse and stole it, 
		saddle and all. We journeyed on to Green River. Previous to leaving Salt 
		Lake City we had prepared a watertight wagon box. We ferried ourselves 
		across the Green River with oars in this wagon box. It served a very 
		good purpose. We reached the Platte River which we had to cross on a 
		raft. Here ten men of the company stopped to help ferry Saints across 
		the River. Brother Young and wife, Doctor Bernhisel, my husband and 
		myself went on to Fort Laramie which was then an old Government station.
		<br />
		<br />
		The second day after we left the company we began to meet train after 
		train of gold seekers going to California. &quot;We traveled along all right 
		until my husband and I took sick with cholera. I came very nearly dying; 
		but he was able to drive. We didn’t dare stop for a day on account of 
		the Indians. When we arrived at Fort Laramie, Brother Young made 
		arrangements to take a wounded man down to the Missouri River. <br />
		<br />
		One evening after the man had gotten able to walk he got out of the 
		wagon and walked awhile. He came upon a camp of gold-seekers who, no 
		doubt, asked him all about the gold mines. He knew my husband had been 
		to the mines and when we reached the camp they hailed us but we drove 
		on. One of the men called after us 'That fellow has got his load and is 
		going back to spend it'. We went on and camped about a mile from the 
		camp we had just passed. <br />
		<br />
		After supper Holdaway when we had put our camp fire out, which we always 
		did for fear of Indians finding us, there came a man from the 
		gold-seekers camp who asked my husband if he would take a lot of letters 
		for their camp over the river. My husband said he would take them if he 
		would get them ready before we left in the morning. The man started back 
		to his camp. Suddenly he came back all excited and said that there were 
		Indians all along the road and that he was frightened to go back to camp 
		and wanted to know if he couldn’t stay all night. My husband asked what 
		kind of Indians he had seen. He said they were Crow Indians. We knew 
		that there were no Crow Indians in that part as it was the section in 
		which the Sioux Indians lived. We then told him we had no place for him 
		to stay and no bedding except a buffalo robe; but the man insisted on 
		staying all night. He took the buffalo robe and laid down under the 
		wagon. <br />
		<br />
		There was a storm coming on and we told him that he had better go on to 
		the next camp, which was about a half mile ahead, and he could get in a 
		tent. Finally he consented, when he found what a terrible storm had come 
		on. My husband, fearing that this man had planned to rob us, took his 
		gun and sat down in the front of our wagon. I wanted him to let me take 
		the sacks of gold out of the wagon and drop them a little way from the 
		wagon. It was so dark that none could have seen them; in the morning I 
		would have got them again. He would not consent to this, so he and Mr. 
		Young sat up all night and waited for an attack which did not come. 
		Doubtless the storm had helped to protect us from being robbed. By 
		morning the storm had passed and all was quiet. <br />
		<br />
		We resumed our journey again. From then on the possibility of being 
		robbed was a constant worry. At the Missouri River Brother and Sister 
		Young and Doctor Bernhisel left and Grandfather and Grandmother went to 
		Kanesville where they remained for about a month to rest, starting for 
		St. Louis about the first of September. When the business arrangements 
		in St. Louis were concluded, they went to Lebanon, St. Clair County, 
		Illinois, where Grandfather's folks lived. Here their first baby, a boy 
		they named George Bradford, was born on the 26 September 1849. He lived 
		only four months. <br />
		<br />
		On March 3, 1850 they left Lebanon and arrived in Kanesville, Iowa, 
		about May 15th; where they received a shipment of woolen mills machinery 
		to bring to the Salt Lake Valley, this being the first machinery of its 
		kind to enter the Valley. In the early part of June they left Kanesville 
		in William Pace's Company. It was divided into two sections, with fifty 
		in each section. <br />
		<br />
		Continuing let me quote from Grandmother's autobiography again: <br />
		<br />
		&quot;Richard Sessions was at the head of our division. (Richard Sessions was 
		Grandmother's Uncle) Everything went well until the cholera broke out. 
		We could not get a bit of good water anywhere. The water in the Platte 
		River was thick with mud and very warm. Many of the company died. We had 
		no boxes to bury them in so they were wrapped in a white sheet and laid 
		in the cold ground, not even a slab to mark their graves. Sometimes a 
		large rock or tree marked their burial place. <br />
		<br />
		&quot;After the cholera died out, we got along real well without an accident 
		for several hundred miles. We had all the buffalo and antelope meat we 
		wanted and some deer meat, which we got in the Black Hills. The Company 
		dried a lot of it and it came in very well, for we needed it when we got 
		out of the buffalo country. <br />
		<br />
		&quot;My husband was on guard at night and during the day he walked ahead and 
		drove the stock. He shod the horses and was looked to as a kind of 
		overseer of the Company. I had to cook for four men and drive our team 
		besides. &quot;We were now getting into the mountains on this side of the 
		Sweetwater River. <br />
		<br />
		Our wagons were loaded with machinery and our horses were just about 
		given out. Our bread stuff was all used up except some whole corn which 
		I made hominy of and we lived on this until we reached the Salt Lake 
		Valley in September 1850. Here and there in the little city were patches 
		of grain and vegetables. <br />
		<br />
		We lived in our wagon until my husband managed to get the walls of a 
		small adobe house up. We put a portion of our things in the little house 
		and stretched a domestic wagon cover over the place where the bed stood 
		which would shelter us for awhile until my husband had time to put a 
		roof on it. He had to get the wagons unloaded and haul hay and weed for 
		the winter. We were living in Big Cottonwood Creek at this time. <br />
		<br />
		There was no floor, no roof and no door in the house. It had been 
		raining for three days -- was still raining -- and in the midst of this 
		on Nov. 1, 1850 my second baby was born. Everything in the house was wet 
		through and streams of water poured through the wagon cover onto my bed. 
		We set pans to catch the water. The baby, which we named Timothy, lived 
		but a few minutes. <br />
		<br />
		&quot;On the 28th of December we left for Provo. I drove in an open wagon all 
		the way. It was just about the coldest weather I ever experienced. We 
		camped out two nights and reached the Fort on the last day of December 
		1850. We could not get a house to live in except an old log cabin with 
		just the walls and a dirt floor. It wasn't very good for winter but we 
		fixed a roof on it and stayed there until March 1851. <br />
		<br />
		We then built us a log cabin on the other side of Provo River. It was 
		neither chinked nor plastered, but it was a paradise compared with the 
		ones we had lived in before. <br />
		<br />
		Next, my husband built a machine shop and set up the first carding 
		machinery brought into this country. Brother David Evans helped to put 
		it up and in October it was ready to begin work. Brother Evans first 
		took charge of running it and then my husband. <br />
		<br />
		Soon after, my husband built a blacksmith shop.&quot; On December 12, 1851, 
		their third child was born, and he was named William Shadrach. <br />
		<br />
		About the middle of November 1852, Shedrick Holdaway married Lucinda's 
		sister, Eliza Haws Pickup. Eliza had married George Pickup, a Mormon 
		Battalion member. They had one son George Pickup, Jr. On 3 September 
		1852 Eliza divorced George Pickup because he became intolerable to live 
		with. He must have been mentally unbalanced as he imagined she was 
		entertaining men and used to stand out behind trees at night watching. 
		She became so frightened of him that she could stand it no longer and 
		divorced him. <br />
		<br />
		Shedrick and Eliza had two children: Eliza born 15 April l854; died an 
		infant, and Marion Haws born 28 February 1855. Lucinda's fourth child 
		Amos David was born 25 Jan 1853 and on 30 April 1854 their fifth child 
		John Madison was born. Eliza died when her son Marion was only five days 
		old and Lucinda took him to raise. This made four children under four 
		years of age for Lucinda to care for. <br />
		<br />
		In the summer of 1855 Shedrick and Lucinda moved into town because the 
		Indians were getting so hostile and it was not safe for the people to 
		live in a scattered condition. Shedrick built a little house between 
		fifth and sixth West on the north side of Center Street. Grandmother 
		says in her history: &quot;These were trying times for us all. The people 
		didn’t know what to expect from the army (Johnston's Army); but were 
		ready to fight in an instant if the call came. All of the men were on 
		guard around town watching for the Indians because they were very 
		annoying and treacherous and no one knew what to expect of them.&quot; <br />
		<br />
		When Johnston's Army left Camp Floyd they burned their wagons. Some of 
		this scrap iron was brought to Prove and made into a threshing machine 
		by Shedrick and his brother David Holdaway. Always active and a leader 
		where there was work to do, Grandfather helped lay out and build the old 
		logging road in Provo Canyon. <br />
		<br />
		In the spring of 1859 Shedrick Holdaway built a saw mill in the South 
		Fork of Provo Canyon. Because the mill was built on the summer hunting 
		ground of the Indians, it cost grandfather several fat steers each year 
		to be left in peace. One year Grandfather had paid his tribute to one 
		band of Indians when later in the year another hostile band came. The 
		Chief sent for Grandfather. The escort took Grandfather to the Chief and 
		seated him on a blanket between two Indian warriors. Of this incident 
		Grandfather said: As I was being taken to the Chief I noticed that the 
		two warriors on the blanket each held a great hunting knife behind him. 
		Seated between them I made the easiest bargain anyone ever got out of 
		me. <br />
		<br />
		His experiences were many and varied as those of any pioneer must be. He 
		was seriously injured a number of times but Grandmother's skillful 
		nursing pulled him through. On one occasion he went to Salt Creek near 
		Nephi for a load of coal. He was helping a man lift his wagon wheel so 
		he could go on, and just as the horses started his foot slipped and he 
		fell under the wheels and the wagon, filled with seventy bushels of 
		wheat went over him breaking every other two pair of ribs open and his 
		collar bone. <br />
		<br />
		At a later time he had set a gun to shoot a bear. The next morning he 
		went to see if the bear had been shot and happened to step on the string 
		which had been arranged to discharge the gun. The gun went off and he 
		received the bullet in his leg, which passed clear through his thigh, 
		but no bones were broken. He almost lost his leg at that time. <br />
		<br />
		Later still, he was working at a saw mill near Scofield and while 
		hauling timber, he was suddenly pitched forward between the horses. They 
		became frightened and dragged him for nearly a mile over rocks. The 
		result was a broken jaw bone in two places, a fractured skull and a 
		badly cut throat. <br />
		<br />
		Clothield Young Newren, his granddaughter, says of him: &quot;About seven 
		miles north and west of Provo on the shores of Utah Lake, Grandfather 
		located a ranch about the year 1873. The land needed water for 
		irrigation, so, aided by his brother David, he laid out a canal along 
		the brow of the West Bench. The perfectness of this piece of engineering 
		filled my mother with awe. One day I heard her say, &quot;But father, how 
		could you do it without any instruments?’ He replied, &quot;David walked 
		ahead of me and I laid it out by the brim of his hat.' That canal is 
		still in use. <br />
		<br />
		During the late 80's Shedrick worked at a sawmill in Scofield but most 
		of his time was spent on the ranch in Vineyard. After the death of my 
		father (Lacy Young) mother and I went to live on the ranch. The 
		following eighteen months were the happiest of my childhood. A devoted 
		grandfather who always had time to listen to me and take care of my 
		wants, was my constant companion. I can now see that the tact he used in 
		getting along with me was a combination of a sense of fairness, an 
		understanding of human nature, and a proper evaluation of fundamentals. 
		His brilliant mind solved problems of human relations just as accurately 
		as it did problems of mathematics. <br />
		<br />
		The hard life on his father's farm when Shedrick was a boy and the long 
		distance to school made attending school impossible most of the time. 
		Altogether he attended school only three months of his life. But his 
		mind was that of a natural born mathematician. Many times mother has 
		told me that when in her school years she could not work out her 
		problems in cube and square root, she got her father to work them for 
		her. He always got the right answer though he did not follow the rules 
		she had to use, but with the right answer she could make her own methods 
		work. <br />
		<br />
		Grandfather was also a master at story-telling. I still remember some he 
		told me. But it was the way he did things that made the deepest 
		impression and demonstrated character traits. One incident I shall never 
		forget. Harry Gammon owned the adjoining land and because of long usage 
		he had a right-of-way on Grandfather's side of the fence. Grandfather 
		did not mind that but Mr. Gammon used to leave the gate open when he 
		went through. It was just too much trouble to get out and shut it. An 
		open gate meant that the cattle got out of the pasture and it took the 
		hired man about half of the day to find them and bring them back. Tried 
		beyond endurance, Grandfather got up early one morning and plowed the 
		end of the north pasture that Mr. Gammon had been using for a road, and 
		turned the irrigation water on it. When he came in he remarked to mother 
		'I'd just like to-to see him try to use it now'. The cattle weren't let 
		out any more because Mr. Gammon had to drive on his side of the fence.
		<br />
		<br />
		Aunt Mary Conrad tells the story that one day Grandmother was 
		complaining to Grandfather about his being away from home so much 
		building roads, canals and ditches, or up in the canyon working at the 
		sawmill, and Grandfather made her this reply: &quot;Well, Cindy, I never 
		expect more out of this old world than I put into it,&quot; which could well 
		be used as a motto for all his posterity. Shedrick Holdaway was a man of 
		marked mechanical skill and ingenuity and could fashion almost anything 
		out of wood and iron. <br />
		<br />
		As years passed he prospered and became a large landowner. He was a 
		public spirited man, participating in every project put forth for the 
		development of land around Provo and the rebuilding of the District. 
		During the Fall before he passed away he attended the State Irrigation 
		Congress, made plans and drew maps for pumping water from Utah Lake into 
		Elberta. It was in the fall of 1902 that Shedrick drove into the yard of 
		the old home in Provo and announced, &quot;Well, Cindy, I've come home to 
		stay&quot;. He immediately began cutting down the&nbsp; big apple trees so 
		that he could have room to build a shop. <br />
		<br />
		Grandfather was a diligent reader of the Bible and could quote large 
		portions of it off by heart. He was a member of the 31st Quorum of 
		Seventies and also a High Priest in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
		Latter-day Saints. <br />
		<br />
		Shedrick Holdaway died 24 December 1902, the 54th anniversary of his
