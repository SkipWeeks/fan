		<strong>HISTORY OF PERCIA CORNELIA GROVER BUNNELL <br />
		</strong>Written by herself at Provo, Utah 13 February 1881 <br />
		<br />
		I, Percia Cornelia Grover, was born the 27th Dec. 1841 in Nauvoo, 
		Illinois. My father was a member of the High Council at the time that 
		plural marriage was revealed to the church, and was called upon to obey 
		the law. He had three wives sealed to him, besides my mother, in the 
		Temple in Nauvoo. <br />
		<br />
		In Feb. 1845, he was counciled with a company of brethern, to start for 
		the west, which he did, taking with him his family. We suffered much 
		with the inclemency of the weather. Our team, being insufficient to take 
		all his family, after traveling two hundred and fifty miles, my mother 
		returned to Nauvoo, taking me with her. <br />
		<br />
		We came out the following September with her father and mother. We 
		suffered much and many fell by the way. Grandpa Nickerson, being in 
		years could not stand the hardships of the journey and fell sick. So we 
		were obliged to stop for the winter on the Platte River, where he died, 
		leaving us without anyone to protect us. <br />
		<br />
		My mother and grandmother returned back to their friends and stayed one 
		year. My great-grandmother died while they were there, aged 94 years. My 
		mother and grandmother then started for the Valley of the Salt Lake. We 
		stopped in Fort Des Moines one winter. <br />
		<br />
		My mother took in washings to get provisions to come to the valley. When 
		we came to Cainesville in the spring, we met with a former friend of my 
		father, from Utah, who had some money belonging to my father. He helped 
		us to get a team to come on to the valley. We had one yoke of oxen and a 
		yoke of cows. We were three months on the way. We were five in the 
		family: mother, grandmother, two brothers and myself. <br />
		<br />
		My oldest brother, twelve years old, with the help of mother drove the 
		team. We all walked most of the way. We arrived in Salt Lake City, Sept. 
		27, 1850. Being too late to put up hay, our stock all died but one. 
		Mother kept school in a small room she rented in Salt Lake City. We 
		lived in the same room and got through the winter without much 
		suffering. <br />
		<br />
		In the fall of 1852, we moved to Provo, where I have lived ever since. I 
		have seen many trials and suffering among the saints but feel to thank 
		the Lord that I am counted worthy to fill a position in the midst of his 
		people. <br />
		<br />
		On Sept 19, 1856, I married to Stephen I. Bunnell. Trusting that my 
		posterity may live faithful to the end and help to bear testimony of the 
		great work which their parents have suffered much to help in these the 
		latter-days and give to themselves salvation in the celestial kingdom of 
		Jesus Christ. I will now sign myself your affectionate mother and sister 
		in the Gospel of our Savior, Jesus Christ, <br />
		<br />
		Signed: Percia Cornelia Bunnell <br />
		<br />
		<strong>Note:</strong> In a Family History written by L. Lamond Bunnell, 
		1972, in his 78th year, and from the recollections of Leona Bunnell 
		Nuttall, both children of Leslie L. and B. J. Bunnell, and therefore 
		grandchildren of Stephen Ithamer and Percia C. G. Bunnell, the following 
		has been added: <br />
		<br />
		Grandma (Percia C. Grover) was the daughter of Thomas Grover and Eliza 
		Nickerson (Hubbard). Both Thomas and Eliza had been married before and 
		both had lost their mates. L. Lamond Bunnell recalls that: Grandma 
		Percia told that when they were crossing the plains, they were held up 
		one whole day because the buffalo were stampeding. It started early in 
		the morning before they had assembled their wagons for the morning 
		start. They were camped in a small grove of trees, one of the few times 
		they had a campsite like that. They first heard a noise like thunder and 
		then saw a cloud of dust. They got the cattle in tight to the camp and 
		waited. They were afraid that the buffalo might come right through the 
		camp but when they were near the grove, they spread out and went around 
		the camp on both sides. They lost a day's journey on account of the 
		stampede. <br />
		<br />
		Grandma was an exceptionally good cook. Many of the Church Authorities 
		have eaten at her home. I remember once when Wilford Woodruff and 
		Lorenzo Snow drove out from Provo in an old dog cart and spent a couple 
		of hours. I was at Grandma's. I think it was when my younger sister 
		Leona was born and Grandpa was babysitting me to keep me out of the way. 
		When the brethren left, they shook hands with me and patted me on the 
		head and told me I was a good boy. I have never forgotten the incident.
		<br />
		<br />
		Grandma was famous for her gooseberry pie. Everyone who ever tasted it 
		wanted the recipe and she was always willing to oblige. She would tell 
		all about how to make it with all the ingredients named except the 
		sugar. When she would come to that part, she always inched up to the 
		edge of her chair, then, lifting her left hand up, she would say, &quot; and 
		now you come to the sugar...&quot; and then she would inch up a bit further 
		and say, &quot;You put in all your conscience will let you and then shut your 
		eyes and throw in three double hands full.&quot; It always got a big chuckle.
		<br />
		<br />
		Grandma was very proud, loyal, industrious, and dignified and had a host 
		of friends. She was very strong willed and had a very quick temper. When 
		she got mad. ...look out: She abhorred laziness. Leona Bunnell Nuttall 
		recalls that: After coming to Utah, Grandmother's mother (Eliza 
		Nickerson Hubbard Grover) taught school to make a living for them even 
		though they lived in only one room at the time. <br />
		<br />
		Her grandmother, Eliza, would shear the sheep, prepare the wool for 
		spinning, then weave the cloth and make it into clothing. When they 
		wanted to dye the cloth, they used bark and berries from the trees and 
		shrubs that grew around the area. Leona remembers a quilt made from 
		pieces from some of the worn-out clothes made from the dyed cloth, and 
		even though the quilt was old, the colors were still bright and 
		beautiful. <br />
		<br />
		Grandma Percia told me about the time her mother (Eliza) made a suit of 
		clothes for a man. She made a mistake and cut the pants so that they 
		buttoned on the wrong side. As she had no more material when she 
		discovered her mistake, she was at a loss to know what to do but finally 
		went ahead and made them up. She told the man that she had made them 
		that way on purpose, because she thought it would be better for him as 
		he was left-handed. The man was very pleased and flattered that she had 
		been so thoughtful. <br />
		<br />
		Because I (Leona) have always been slow and lazy (Grandma Percia had no 
		patience for those traits in anyone) my memories and impressions of 
		Grandma in my early life are not always of the most complimentary kind. 
		She was an extremely hard worker herself. She spent a lot of time at our 
		home and did a lot to help. I'm not sure that either Mother (Ellen B.J. 
		Bunnell) or I appreciated it and it has left me with a fear of doing the 
		wrong thing in the wrong way, when I want to help someone. <br />
		<br />
		As I got older, I learned to appreciate and admire her more. I do 
		appreciate her real desire for service and her faith and determination. 
		Although many things happened to try her faith, she never faltered. Once 
		when I dared to criticize a step one of the Church Authorities had 
		taken, she straightened me out good by telling me that with all the 
		members of the church praying for the Lord to guide the Authorities in 
		their decisions, that their counsel could not be wrong. <br />
		<br />
		I (Leona) remember her telling me how many of the people of Provo used 
		to drive out for her dinners. She said that the reason her food tasted 
		better than other cooks was because she always had and used plenty of 
		good thick cream in most of her recipes. She was very proud of her 
		friends among the &quot;best&quot; (as she called them) people of Provo: the 
		Knights, the Twelves, the Smoots, and many others. <br />
		<br />
		However, she was also modest. She told me once that the only reason she 
		was on the Stake Board of the Relief Society was because she had a horse 
		and buggy to haul the women who didn't have a horse and buggy around. In 
		her later years, after she and Grandpa (Steven Ithamer Bunnell) were 
		divorced...she didn't believe in polygamy and saw what polygamy did to 
		her own mother's life...she lived alone. <br />
		<br />
		She built a small two room home south of Lars Jacobsen's home. She had a 
		barn for Old Jim, her horse. She had Old Jim barn-broken. He always 
		waited until Grandma came out in the morning to take him out of the barn 
		to a corner of his yard. He just never dirtied the barn for her to have 
		to shovel out. Grandma had a carriage that was called a phaeton which 
		she used for transportation. It did not have sides but was low slung 
		which made it easier for her to get in and out of. <br />
		<br />
		Old Jim was a very good buggy horse...one of the best trotting horses in 
		the area. He was one of the racing horses that her son, Steve, used to 
		use but was now too old for him. Many people tried to &quot;pass&quot; Grandma and 
		Old Jim but they were never successful. All Grandma had to do was to 
		say, &quot;Come on Jim&quot; and his back would drop as he reached out into his 
		fast stride and he left his contender behind him. Many times we would 
		see a cloud of dust down the road and would say, &quot;Wonder who Grandma is 
		racing now?&quot; Sure enough, here would come Grandma sitting right on the 
		edge of the front seat, talking to Old Jim. I never knew of him being 
		beaten in one of these races. He always made Grandma proud of him. <br />
		<br />
		Much of this was when she was in her late 70's. In the fall, when 
		[sugar] beet digging time arrived, Grandma used to carry a stick with a 
		nail in the end in the buggy with her. Quite often one of the wagons 
		loaded with beets, driving to the factory to unload, would drop off a 
		beet alongside the road. Old Jim loved to eat the beets. When he would 
		see one, he would stop and Grandma would spear the beet with stick and 
		nail and put it in the buggy for that evening's dessert for Old Jim.
		<br />
		<br />
		Grandma Percia was one of the few women who could speak the Indian 
		dialect. Lamond remembers one 24th of July Celebration in Provo, when 
		each ward in Utah Stake had to represent a certain phase of Pioneer 
		life. Lakeview had to be the Indians. Lamond's mother [Ellen] made him 
		an Indian outfit out of new burlap: “pants with fringe and a jacket, and 
		a quiver for my arrows. One of the neighbors, Art Taylor, had a real 
		Indian mare, a small typical Indian pony that he let me ride in the 
		parade. As we passed Grandma Percia's place in Provo, she was outside by 
		the fence. She treated us as real Indians and talked Indian talk to us 
		as long as we were within hearing distance. I was so proud of her 
		accomplishment in being able to speak like an Indian.&quot; <br />
		<br />
		Grandma died the second of February 1924 at Provo, Utah.<br />

		<strong>Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Sr. and Percia Cornelia Graver Family
		<br />
		</strong>by Helen Bunnell Weeks, a great-granddaughter <br />
		<br />
		&quot;I was born in the State of Michigan, [Brownstown] Wayne County, Feb. I, 
		1834, and resided there with my parents David Edwin Bunnell &amp; Sarah 
		(Sally) Hellen Conrad, until the spring of 1842...In the spring of 1852, 
		we started across the Great American Desert and arrived in Salt Lake 
		City, Oct. 5th.&quot; • Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Sr., then, a young man of 
		eighteen-years of age, settled on the north bank of Provo river, West of 
		the Lakeview -Geneva road where he befriended the Indians. This 
		friendship later resulted in saving the lives of some early pioneers who 
		would otherwise have been ambushed and killed, by the Indians, had it 
		not been for &quot;Hankaboo,&quot; He later built his home about 1/2 mile north of 
		the Provo River. It was a tall two-story grey house built on the west 
		side of Lakeview road, just south of the old Sugar Beet Factory. 
		Bunnells tried to live the United Order: &quot;Stephen Ithamer Bunnell turned 
		over a lot containing part of the Old Fort Wall in Provo, a musket, some 
		and cattle and other things.&quot; Marriage: Stephen Ithamer Bunnell, Sr. 
		married Percia Cornelia Grover [daughter of Thomas Grover and Caroline 
		Eliza Nickerson] on 19 September 1856, when she was fifteen years old 
		and he was twenty-two. Shortly after his marriage he volunteered to help 
		rescue members of the ill-fated Willey and Martin Handcart Companies &quot;I 
		went east on the plains for emigrants that had started across the Great 
		Desert, a distance of one-thousand miles, some on foot, carrying their 
		provisions and clothing on handcarts. Many were starved and frozen to 
		death during the journey and some became cripples for life through 
		freezing.&quot; Bunnell participated in Walker War: Grandson, L. Lamond 
		Bunnell recalls: &quot;Grandpa was called at one time to go with a group of 
		men after some of (Indian) Chief Walker's men who had killed a white man 
		on Mapleton bench. The Indians had gone up Spanish Fork Canyon and the 
		group of White men went after them. The White men hunted until they were 
		afraid to stay any longer because of darkness, then they headed down the 
		canyon. Years later, at a Black Hawk Encampment at the Old Provo Lake 
		Resort, an old Indian came up to him, calling him 'Hankaboo,' a nickname 
		the Indians had given him, and said, 'Hankaboo, you remember when you go 
		up Spanish Fork Canyon after Indian who killed white man on Mapleton 
		Bench? Grandpa said that he did. The old Indian continued: 'You ride 
		little gray mare. She get rock in foot. You no ride. You run up behind. 
		Hold tail. You remember place where bushes along side of trail?' Grandpa 
		said he remembered: 'It was a place about two-hundred yards long where 
		there was just room enough for the horses to go through between the 
		bushes.' The Indian went on: 'Injun on both side. Many Injun. Going to 
		kill white man. No can lift gun, so not kill white man. White man's God 
		heap Big!'&quot; Characteristics: Fun-loving, trickster, hot-tempered, 
		courageous: Grandpa &quot;Thame&quot; was known for his tall tales, braggadocio 
		and tricks he liked to play on others. Grandpa baits the bully in the 
		old swimming hole: A great granddaughter, Renee Frazier tells of group 
		of boys swimming in the Provo River. The town bully, wearing a buckskin 
		suit, was being particularly obnoxious this day. Grandpa kept baiting 
		him, while keeping his distance, until the rest of the boys were 
		dressed. Grandpa stood , gazing at the water, while watching the bully 
		out of the corner of his eye. He saw the bully running toward him, as 
		fast as he could. Just as he was about to give Grandpa a good shove into 
		the water. Grandpa stepped aside and the bully went, head ver heels, 
		into the water. The boys tookoff -- as-fasTas they could to avoldhis 
		wrath. The buTlyTJared not return home nTnTs&quot; wet suit so, he took it 
		off and hung it on the bushes to dry. When he tried putting it nn aoaiti

		Not one perished! Now, we traveled through the cold snow and frozen

		return to Nauvoo. Another son was on 27 September 1846...the day after 
		he was born...we once again crosse Mississippi river. For the next seven 
		weeks, we continued traveling, living c doors in covered wagons. I was 
		unable to dress my little son, once, in a hi during that whole period of

		East) and stayed one year (1848). My great-grandm (Abigail Chase 
		Chapman) died while they were there, aged 94 years. We cam the following 
		September with her father and mother. Grandpa [Fre Nickerson], being in 
		years could not stand the hardships of the journey. He and was buried on 
		the bank of the Platte river. [Percia said that after the tn her mother 
		had in getting to &quot;the valley&quot;...Eliza would have nothing more to dc 
		Thomas Grover. She did not believe in Polygamy. Eliza divorced Grover an 
		later sealed to her first husband, Marshall Moore Hubbard. 21 Feb 1851.] 
		Westward journey: &quot;My mother and grandmother once again started ft 
		Valley of the Salt Lake. We stopped in Fort Des Moines one winter. My m 
		took in washings to get provisions to come to the valley. Buffalo stamj 
		&quot;Grandma Percia told me that when they were crossing the plains, they 
		were up one whole day because the buffalo were stampeding. It started 
		early i morning, before they had assembled their wagons for the morning

		took i: off and hung it on the bushes to dry. When he tried putting it 
		on again, it had shrunk to a midget size. 2nd encounter with a bully: On 
		another occasion Grandpa, or &quot;Nimrod,&quot; as we sometimes called him, took 
		a load of wheat to Bingham, Utah. As he unloaded the seamless sacks of 
		wheat onto the platform, each sack had to be weighed. A big six-foot man 
		was being a nuisance. Each time as the scale was balanced, this man 
		moved the balance so Grandpa cold not read the weight. Finally, Grandpa 
		told him: &quot;Mister, if you do that again I shall be forced to chastise 
		you!&quot; The big guy moved the balance again. This time Grandpa was ready 
		for him and he hit him on the chin as hard as he could. He knew he had 
		broken his knuckle but he had knocked the bully off the platform and 
		onto the ground. He then jumped off the platform, right on top of the 
		still-down butly and tromped him until the bully begged to be let up. 
		Then, one of the bystanders said to the bully: &quot;Well, Mister, you have 
		been looking for a Mormon fight all day and you picked the smallest man 
		in the bunch. I hope you are satisfied now.&quot; Grandpa, the courageous 
		hunter: &quot;Grandma (Percia) said that Grandpa never failed to bring home 
		the first prize in any shooting contest he ever entered. At one time, 
		grandpa and another man trailed a mountain lion to a cave but did not 
		feel it was a good thing to go in the cave in the dark, so they made 
		another trip and brought some miner's candles and caps so they could 
		see. They drew straws to see who would go in and Grandpa got the short 
		straw. While he went into the cave, the other man stood watch on the 
		outside. Soon the man on the outside heard a shot and then a lion came 
		dashing out of the cave. The man outside shot the lion and was laughing 
		because &quot;Thame&quot; had missed a shot. But he quit laughing when Thame came 
		out dragging another lion out of the cave. There had been two lions. 
		Thame had shot the big one between the eyes by the light of the candle 
		and the other one had knocked him down getting out of the cave. &quot;Cougar 
		Story: &quot;Ithamer and his dog were walking in the grove, by Provo River, 
		just above the river bridge in Lakeview. A mountain lion dropped on him, 
		from a tree. He had no weapon with him so, Thame choked the lion, and, 
		with the help of his dog, killed the lion. Thame came walking home, with 
		the lion's paws over his shoulders, and the tail, dragging on the 
		ground. I had to tend the many deep scratches on Thame's back and arms.&quot; 
		(Karl Bunnell) Indian horses in the oats: When Grandpa first moved onto 
		the farm, the Indians under Black Hawk the 3rd. used to come and camp on 
		the farm to get their winter supply of fish. They would catch suckers 
		when they ran up the river to spawn. The suckers were easily caught then 
		and there was a good supply. Right after the second grasshopper war. 
		Grandpa had been able to plant three acres of oats and the well-growing 
		oats were in the 'boot' when the Indians came. The oats were fenced by 
		the only fence on the farm. When Black Hawk came to see about camping, 
		Grandpa told him to turn his horses in the oats but to keep the brave's 
		horses out. The next morning, when Grandpa got up, every horse was in 
		the oats. Grandpa could not take this. He grabbed his black snake whip 
		and proceeded to lash at every brave he could reach. At first, the 
		braves took it in fun as a game, but when they became mad (that whip 
		could sting). Black Hawk, who was watching from his tepee, told the 
		braves to take their horses out. That was where Grandpa got his Indian 
		name: &quot;Hankaboo,&quot; which means growl. Indian wants Percia for his squaw! 
		&quot;The Indians were often visitors at Grandpa's farm. One Hankitiwats 
		(meaning Red Whiskers) used to watch Grandma Percia milk the cows. One 
		time when she was through, he said: &quot;Me kill Hankaboo, you be my squaw!&quot; 
		She was scared half to death, but knew that you should never let an 
		Indian know you were scared, so she looked him right in the eye and 
		said: &quot;You kill Hankaboo, I kill you!&quot; He grunted, walked away and it 
		was three years before she saw him again. Caught in the rain: In his 
		later years, Grandpa &quot;Thame&quot; was staying at his sons place in Vineyard, 
		(Stephen Ithamer, Jr.) He had his wagon backed under the shed and was 
		sleeping in it. One night, it began to rain and my father, Joel and his 
		the following September with her father and mother. Grandpa [Freeman 
		Nickerson], being in years could not stand the hardships of the journey. 
		He died and was buried on the bank of the Platte river. (Percia said 
		that after the trouble her mother had in getting to 'the valley&quot;...Eliza 
		would have nothing more to do with Thomas Grover. She did not believe in 
		Polygamy. Eliza divorced Grover and was later sealed to her first 
		husband, Marshall Moore Hubbard, 21 Feb 1851.] Westward journey: &quot;My 
		mother and grandmother once again started for the Valley of the Salt 
		Lake. We stopped in Fort Des Moines one winter. My mother took in 
		washings to get provisions to come to the valley. Buffalo stampede: 
		&quot;Grandma Percia told me that when they were crossing the plains, they 
		were held up one whole day because the buffalo were stampeding. It 
		started early in the morning, before they had assembled their wagons for 
		the morning start. They were camped in a small grove of trees, one of 
		the few times they had a camp site like that. They first heard a noise, 
		like thunder, and then saw a cloud of dust. They got the cattle in 
		tight_to_the_camp a^djyajtrd. T.icy wen: afraid that the 
		TuTfaTnfflgTnoTneTlglirTnroTigTnnecSrnp, out when Uiey&quot; were near the 
		grove, they spread out and went around the camp on both sides. They lost 
		a day's journey on account of the stampede.&quot; [Grandson, L. Lamond 
		Bunnell] &quot;We arrived in Salt Lake City 27 Sept 1850, being too late to 
		put up hay, our stock all died but one. Mother taught school in a small 
		room she rented in the Old Fort in Salt Lake City. We lived in the same 
		room and got through the winter without much suffering. &quot;In the fall of 
		1852, we moved to Provo, where I have lived ever since. Grandchilden 
		remember her: Gooseberry pie. Everyone who ever tasted it wanted the 
		recipe and she was always willing to oblige. She would tell all about 
		how to make it with all the ingredients named except the sugar. When she 
		came to that part, she always inched up to the edge of her chair, then, 
		lifting her left hand up, she would say: 'and now you come to the 
		sugar...' and then she would inch up a bit farther and say: 'you put in 
		all your conscience will let you and then shut your eyes and throw in 
		three double hands full!' It always got a big chuckle. Percia's work 
		ethic: Grandma Percia abhorred laziness! She was an extremely hard 
		worker herself. She was very strong-willed and had a verj quick temper. 
		When she got mad . .. look out! I do appreciate her real desire for 
		service and her faith and determination. Grandma was very proud, loyal, 
		industrious and dignified and had a host of friends. Grandma Percia was 
		one of the few women who could speak the Indian dialect. (Leona Nuttal) 
		Percia's Old Jim was bam broke. He always waited until Grandma came out 
		in the morning to take him out of the bam to a corner of the yard. He 
		just nevei dirtied the barn for her to have to shovel out. Old Jim loved 
		sugar beets: &quot;In tht fall, when beet-digging time arrived. Grandma used 
		a stick to nail fallen sugai beets, on the road, for Old Jim's evening 
		dessert.' Grandma Percia and her carriage: Old Jim was a very good buggy 
		horse . . one of the best trotting horses in the area.. .Many times we 
		would see a cloui of dust down and road and would say: 'Wonder who 
		Grandma is racing now? Sure enough, here would come Grandma, in her late 
		70's, sitting right on the edg of the front seat, talking to Old Jim. 
		After Grandpa &quot;Thame'' and Grandm. Percia divorced, they each came 
		visiting, alone, to our house: she in her fas buggy, drawn by Old Jim; 
		and he, with his horse and wagon, which he slept in (Leona Nuttall) 
		Their marriage lasted fifty-four years and produced twelve children, six 
		o whom survived to adulthood and married: Stephen Ithamar Bunnell, Jr.8

		believe in polygamy after seeing what polygamy ha done to her own 
		mother's life) In her later years, after she and Grandpa were divorced 
		she lived alone in small two-room home in Lakeview. A granddaughter,
